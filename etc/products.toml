The 1990 Studio Grand Piano is amongst one of our favorite virtual instruments ever done. This extraordinary library contains over 48.000 samples and unique microphones/positions, including Neumann 87’s, Coles, Neve SE Ribbon’s, AKG 414’s and Neumann KM 184’s. Everything was lovingly recorded & processed at a famous hi-tech British Studio through one of the greatest custom NEVE desks in existence. 

We wanted to create a hyper-realistic virtual instrument that pays an homage to its counter-part in reality – the incredibly versatile and studio defacto, Yamaha C7. The piano is best described as incredibly versatile and fantastic for pop, rock, classical, fusion and all in-between. The sustain samples were carefully crafted at both pedal up and pedal down positions. We also have bonus sampled staccato and staccatissimo notes (w/round robin each), so you have the correct attack for faster runs. In addition, the library gives you full control over the dynamic response as well as mechanics and tone, so you can dial in the perfect sound & dynamic match for your workflow – all simply done with a click of the mouse. We also included full control over resonance, room tone and signal chain noise, non-tonal key control, unique release triggers for hammer action, string damping, and release triggers for our room and ambient microphones. In essence you have everything right at your fingertips and most importantly – it just works effortlessly.\

Starting with the Violins, this newly reworked volume brings you the latest improvements in programming and workflow previously found only in our critically acclaimed Century Series. The update includes the familiar and easy to use Century interface, remastered articulations, a powerful articulation matrix, integrated mixing capabilities, and for advanced real-time processing, our Chaos Effects.

With the new advanced Articulation browser, you can create your very own matrix of custom playing styles to suit your compositional needs. You can easily balance each articulation and assign each style its own dedicated Key-switch or Midi CC. Whether you are building a template and need to separate the long and short articulations; building performance-based patches out of the dozens of playing styles; or creating a custom set of patches needed for your specific arrangement, Adagio gives you the power to shape this iconic sound to your workflow.

Say goodbye to Multis. With the update to Adagio, you will find various remastered layered Legato articulations made from 11 independent styles of lyrical Legato.

These Legatos have been completely reworked and redesigned to make expressive string writing completely effortless. The new legatos now adapt to the way you play, a softer velocity will trigger a more passionate set of Legato transitions, whereas playing more intensely triggers Legatos with a stronger transition.

The Adagio series was recorded in a beautiful church environment and contains three main groups of master violinists: Full Ensemble Violins (11 Players), Small Ensemble or Chamber Violins (3 Players) and a Solo Virtuoso Violinist (1 Player). Each section was sampled to capture the raw emotions and true expression within each string ensemble. Every articulation has been extensively sampled, including a total of 11 individual legato techniques, each with up to three times round robin, and a wealth of dynamic short notes including multiple styles of Spiccato. Each articulation is sampled with movement and character; the natural expression in each sample makes for a truly authentic playing experience that will be instantly noticeable in your next production.\

8Dio Aura Guitars is the ultimate collection of deep-sampled motion picture guitars.  Aura Guitars contains 12 different guitars, including Martin, 12 String, Dobro, Mandolin, Ukulele, 8 String Schecter, Silent Guitar, Stratocaster, Telecaster, Les Paul and assortment of Bass Guitars. It contains both multi-sampled single notes and multi-sampled chords. All the chords were sampled in perfect fifth, so you can essentially generate any chord and rhythm you want. All 12 guitars were sampled symmetrically – meaning that you can freely blend anything you want and it will work together. So you literally have billions of patch combinations.

Aura Guitars contains 3 modules, so you can freely mix and blend up to three different guitars together. The collection spans over 9GB of content (lossless compressed from 17GB) and several thousand auras. Aura Guitars also contains an advanced grid-sequencer, which allows you to completely create your own signature rhythms by using velocity, pan, pitch and on/off functions for each step in the Aura. All the guitars were also multi-sampled, so when you play chords you can freely mix between muted/non-tonal strums and glide into rich, open chords by using the modwheel. In addition we also multi-sampled the single notes, so you can create more realistic sounding guitar rhythms.

Aura Guitars is designed for instant gratification. It is insanely easy to use and get inspired – and it also allows you to go incredibly deep and even into the realm of chaos. We created chaos features both both patches, grid-sequencing and FX. So with one click the library can generate a completely new patch – with one click it can generate a completely new grid-sequence and with one click it can randomize all the FX. In essence you have an infinite amount of combinations and it just makes the library a true inspiration to work with.\

So imagine playing a unique Caisa with brushes or sticks. The ability to choose mallets widens the usability of the library, especially in regards to cinematic scoring.

Aura Tonal Exotic Studio Percussion contains 3 microphone positions (Close, Mid, Room) that each have a very distinct sound. We’ve also included a new dual layered FX system. The first part is our front-face FX system that gives you control over dynamics, filters, pitch and micro-pitch, delay, bit-resolution and our new textural convolution delay. The new textural delay allows you to take and use them as delay components, so the instrument will delay other sounds than just itself. We’ve also included our new Chaos FX engine, which gives you a large control over things such as EQ, Distortion, Stereo-Delay and an additional convolution reverb.

It has always been our mantra to push sampling forward in regards to realism and playability. Aura Studio Exotic Percussion is the first of several to utilize our proprietary Groove Sampling™ method and we really think it is going to make compositions richer and easier to create.\

The library features five highly expressive solo woodwind players, a Flute, Oboe, Cor Anglais, Clarinet, and Bass Clarinet. Each player was recorded in isolation, but all at the same time, so you can fluidly switch between any instrument and any articulation without compromising the sound or timing of your music. 

The sound of the ensemble is easily customizable with the wealth of options in the advanced user-interface. Each instrument also allows for extreme control over the stereo image with individual volume, panning, output routing, and the new distance control, which enables you to freely blend between a direct signal and a more spacious and ambient microphone position. 

Intimate Studio Woodwinds contains a vast collection of 26 articulations covering everything you need to create authentic-sounding woodwind melodies. Each articulation is sorted into four main categories (Traditional, Arcs, Performance, and Effects), making them all quickly and easily accessible from the built-in browser. The advanced user interface allows you to load and unload the articulations of your choosing, so you only have to load the sounds you need for your project. The Legatos are incredibly agile and can play almost anything you throw at them.\

Ostinato Strings Chapter II features a dynamically arranged ensemble of 6 Violins, 6 Violas, 4 Cellos, and 4 Double Basses. Each section was independently recorded to allow for ultimate flexibility and customization in the production process. This collection of instruments perfectly captures the essence and realism of many iconic ostinato based string patterns used in modern cinema, making this latest chapter the perfect companion to any orchestral palette. 

Each figure is not only available across an instrument’s musical range, but is also fully host tempo synchronized. Utilizing our “poly-time” legato mode also offers you the ability to change a phrase’s pitch mid-way through the pattern, allowing for an almost endless array of rhythmic and tonal possibilities. 

The entire Ostinato Strings series was painstakingly captured at 96 kHz before being carefully down-sampled to 48 kHz for ease of streaming. Each recording session also featured only the very best in recording equipment, ensuring an analog signal path and carefully managed workflow. This not only preserves and enhances the accuracy and character of each instrument, but helps us to truly honor the sound of these master musicians.

Both Leslies are available within the 8Dio Vintage Organ. “Analog” highlights the natural acoustics of the Hammond® Leslie and its expressive spinning states.  “Modelled” demonstrates the static, non-spinning, pure timbre of the Leslie cabinet, with a virtual rotation applied. This allows you to choose the tone and workflow that best suits you.

We recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples.

True Legato

Multiple sets of true legato intervals were recorded both with and without vibrato, for the ultimate in realistic sounding performance.

Trills/Tremolos

Select this articulation, and you can play a trill or tremolo between any two notes by holding them down on the keyboard (up to seven notes apart/a perfect fifth). See the video demo below for a demonstration of this.

Key Noises

These woodwind instruments owe part of the character of their sound to the mechanics of the instrument, so we decided to come up with something that allows some form of control over this subtle characteristic in timbre. What we ended up with was a knob that can control the level of mechanical noise that is audible from the instrument. You can turn this up, or off completely in the GUI to set the average level that seems right, and it will then, on top of this, react to the velocity of your own playing, much like it would a real player pressing harder or softer.

Please note, as vibrato on the Clarinet is not a standard technique, we have not included it, but the other four instruments all include vibrato legato as WELL as non vibrato legato and sustains, all at multiple crossfade-able dynamic layers (MIDI CC1/Mod Wheel).
You are even able to control the level/volume of the key sounds/mechanics of the instruments, and the sound of the flautist pressing the keys will also be louder depending on how hard you press the key on your MIDI keyboard (velocity).

One feature we are exceptionally proud of is the intuitive trills articulation system, which allows you to play any trill/tremolo within the flute's playable range up to a perfect fifth (seven chromatic notes)... See the demo video for an insight in to how this works!

With an instrument as diverse, capable, and exposed as the violin, there is no cutting corners, so we strived to capture as much of the possible sounds a violin can make as possible, resulting in the huge list of articulations you can see below, as well as four sampled legato styles, also shown below. We even specially sampled slurred and bowed legato so you can correctly and realistically phrase passages, and a specially sampled "fast legato" set of intervals, which will allow you to play virtuosic runs and scale passages.

On top of this, we want our instruments to be as close in sonic-flexibility to a real situation as they can be, so in addition to providing close and stage mic positions, we have also made sure to have both a ribbon and condenser mic, which you can choose to switch between. Both sounds offer so much in their own right, the ribbon having a beautiful smooth tone, and the condenser being ruthless in exposing every little detail in the sound.

The stereo mic position can be widened and narrowed by dragging the mics in the interface.

We wanted to make this instrument even more musical, so we have once again used our idea of the "phrase builder", which allows you to select the attack, or beginning sound of a phrase, and then switch around the type of legato throughout a musical phrase.

One huge give-away that an instrument is a sampled one and not a real instrument is how the beginning of every musical phrase sounds the same. A great performer will not sound like this. They will vary the phrase beginnings, and perhaps start some quietly, some with an FP, some with a stutter, and so we have included five options for this, to ensure that your compositions sound evolving, musical, and extremely convincing.

The width of the stereo mic perspective can be changed by dragging the bottom pair of microphones in the interface, and dynamics can be brought up and down by either the mod wheel or expression Midi CC - depending on whether you have MOD or EXP selected in the bottom right hand corner of the instrument GUI, and the shorts' dynamics are controlled by velocity.

Four True-sampled Legato Styles

We spent a while tackling how to approach allowing the user to play both slow more drawn out passages, and then also being able to create realistic renditions of more virtuosic, fast passages, and eventually came up with a very intricate technique which allows both.

We sampled these intervals completely differently, and set it up so you can switch between these depending on whether you are playing fast or not. So for the faster legato, you can switch to "fast" with the legato keyswitching, and play intervals up to and including a minor third in your scales and runs, maintaining a very realistic sound. The sound of the note transitions on a violin when playing fast is completely different from the sound when playing slower, and both are captured and skilfully programmed into this instrument.

Types of Legato

* Slurred Legato - switching note with the finger only, without changing bow direction... the smoothest legato sound.
* Bowed Legato - changing the bow at the note change. A more noticeable interval. (slurred and bowed legato are both essential in obtaining a realistic and well phrased performance)
* Portamento Legato - a subtle slide between notes.
* Fast Legato - Specially sampled intervals which allow you to play fast runs/scales with intervals up to a minor third between each note - something seriously lacking and rarely possible with most sample libraries.

ARTICULATION LIST

* Normal Sustain
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)
* Crescendo
* FP (loud then suddenly quiet with a crescendo back up)
* Marcato (A more accented pronounced attack and note)

We are proud to present Octohorn, the first release from our brass series, with an eight-player French Horn ensemble, boasting no less then seven mic positions, with the aims of giving you absolute and ultimate control over your soundscape.

This instrument was created with the intentions of producing something in a completely new league of sonic sculpt-ability, able to sit in a track with the depth and spread of a real ensemble recording. We have achieved this through multiple new and innovative features, including the seven mic positions, carefully set to cover the whole soundscape, recorded chords and octaves to minimize "sample layering" in tracks, which kills the depth of a track, and much more...

Mix between the perspectives; Decca tree sides and mid, flanks, room, woodwind spots (see more about this below!), close ribbons and close LDCs, with the flexibility aimed at replicating a real scoring session. Now you have control over the different mic and perspective levels in the session, enabling you to morph your own sound in your scores, as if you were at the studio with the console at your fingertips.

You might have noticed that one of the perspectives included is "woodwind spots". While this is not a woodwind library, the mics that spot the woodwinds were set up and included in the recording. The reason for this, is that a lot of the brass sound bleeds heavily into the woodwind mics in scoring sessions, adding to the perceived depth of the sound, so whilst pushing to achieve the most versatile, we felt that this absolutely had to be included.

Three True-sampled Legato Styles

The instrument comes with three true legato modes - a normal slurred legato, a sample octave legato, and a fast legato, for faster passages,which will allow you to play virtuoso runs and scale passages.

The reason we included octave sustains and legato, is because when you play octaves by layering the same instrument twice, what you are hearing is no longer a real octave passage, but two sets of the exact same horns, in the exact same position, layered on top of one another. When an ensemble plays real octave, every note has it's own sonic space and position in hall, and therefore in the perceived depth/stereo field, and you lose this by layering samples. For this reason, we recorded octave sustains and legato specially for a completely true and real sound. 

Not only did we just record the octaves, we recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... again for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples. With this instrument, you can achieve that real spacious sound.

Full list of articulations:

* No Legato (allows polyphonic playing)
* Legato - normal slurred legato (piano and forte dynamic layers crossfade-able)
* Oct Legato - True octave legato
* Fst Legato - Fast legato specially for fast playing
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)
* Chords < - Crescendo major, minor and open 5th chords
* Chords > - Diminuendo major, minor and open 5th chords
* Staccato - Short notes, with up to 5RR per dynamic layer (three layers)

Music composition and production is constantly evolving, and the tools used to create music need to evolve along with this. The concept for this library involved capturing colours from a string orchestra which have not yet been recorded for any sample library, and place them at your fingertips, ready to compose and perform with.

Angel Strings Vol.1 Includes textural elements, morphing into/out from atonality, risers/divebombs ideal for building tension (for example in trailer music), different styles of spiccato/staccato, marcato to soft attacks with sustains, fast tempo-locked tremolo for powerful driving string hooks and more...

The techniques and articulations available in Angel Strings Vol.1 were cleverly recorded with the entire string orchestra in the same room all at once, in a way that seamlessly blends from the bottom of the range (double basses) to the highest violin notes. You can play the entire orchestra with each articulation across a single keyboard with a single NKI, making this library perfect for anything from merely sketching your ideas out on a full keyboard range - to easily executing unique parts for your final compositions.

THE STUDIOANGEL STUDIOS
This library was recorded at Angel Studios in London, where countless pop/rock stars have recorded (notably Adele's "21"), and many major film and video game scores have been recorded, including The Lion King, Jackie, Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Horizon: Zero Dawn and many more...

Angel Strings Vol.1 is another collaboration between Auddict and the fantastic "United Strings of Europe", a London-based ensemble made up of young professionals from across the European Union and Switzerland with the goal of promoting musical and cultural cooperation at the highest level.

The ensemble is gaining recognition for its exciting performances in Switzerland, France, Lebanon and the UK. With several world premieres of works by Hristic, Marinkovic and Winkler, the ensemble has collaborated with a number of distinguished artists including Hildegarde Fesneau, Marc Benzekri, Mateja Marinkovic, Jack Liebeck, Walter Delahunt and Ljubisa Jovanovic.

You can transform the hard-hitting drummer trio we used during the sessions (which gave the library its name) into an army of players, ready to crush anything standing in their way.

The three headed monster.

Cerberus is all about tight and punchy drums, covering from Gran Cassas, Kicks, Toms and Snares to Clacks and Clicks. We recorded a trio of players, each one playing two drums at the same time, giving you a total of 6 simultaneous sounding drums. This results in a larger-than-life sound without losing any tightness.

You need more players?, here’s an army for you.

Because bigger is better than big, Cerberus offers a state-of-the-art functionality for stacking drums. We recorded the triple amount of round robins, so you could stack up to 3 different layers. That gives you 18 simultaneous sounding drums! You can even add timing/pan variation to each hit to make it sound looser/broader.

Droom Loops.

Cerberus comes loaded with a large set of tempo synced drum loops, all created from the original source material. The loops come in 120bpm, 90bpm, 4/4, and 3/4 variations. Each loop additionally has the low, mid, and high stems laid out on the keyboard, allowing you to layer stems to create your own combinations. For a TV or library composer who writes lots of underscore, these loops are going to be incredible time savers.

Still not enough? Here’s an extra full drum kit.

We included a beautiful sounding drum kit just in case you’re feeling those metal/rock vibes, the icing of the cake.

The goal throughout the whole project was to start with the user experience and the raw sound and to work our way backwards to a final product that is both versatile and instantly inspiring.
The Gravitas Piano was designed specifically for trailer music. A piano that can cut through in a big and epic mix, yet still retain a lot of warmth and depth. To achieve this, we used a set of six stereo microphones and then combined these with their corresponding sound-designed (“Synthetic”) counterparts in post production.

Organic Piano: Yamaha Baby Grand Piano

* 2x Brauner Phantom Classic Front End Audio Microphones (above the piano)
* 2x DPA 4011A Cardioid Microphones (below the piano)
* 2x Neumann KM184 Small-diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphones (above the keys, one on each side of the player)
* 2x Neumann U87 Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphones (inside the lid)
* 2x Coles 4038 Ribbon Microphones (inside the lid)
* 2x Earthworks QTC40 Small-diaphragm Omnidirectional Condenser Microphones (room)

The Gravitas Piano comes with 35 “Synthetic” presets, made by some of the best producers in the trailer industry. These “Synthetic” presets can be accessed via the preset control on the “Synthetic” side of the piano. The “Organic” piano offers both Sustained and Staccato articulations. All of the “Synthetic” presets were made using the original samples from the “Organic” piano. No synthesizers or other instruments were used, just pure sound manipulation and sound design.

* Bryan Leach

Red Planet Piano (Piano meets Electric Guitar).

The “Red Planet Piano” was heavily inspired by the movie adaptation of Andy Weir’s “The Martian”. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is absolutely amazing and inspired us to create an “outer space” version of the Klavier. 
The Red Planet Piano shares the same organic sample pool used for the Gravitas Piano. But to get that particular “outer space” electric guitar sound, we created a number of complex guitar sounds. They are designed to match that lush and wide sound that you need to evoke that feeling of depth and space. This, combined with the organic piano, creates a truly unique sound.
We used a blend of the neck (humbucker) and the split-coil (single coil) position of the very limited Ibanez JPM90HAM. A perfect blend of the single coil twang and directness and the warmth and depth of the neck humbucker. The initial recordings were done direct and we then reamped the recordings through various amp and fx signal chains.\

Two types of long-form true legato | No key-switching required.

Introducing Legato Combined

We recorded two types of legato for each instrument: Rebowed and Slurred for Strings, Fingered and Retongued for Woodwinds and Brass, Aah and Ooh for the Sopranos. You can even switch between the two types of legato without using key-switches, by using either velocity or CC. 

Less is more.

We recorded just one dynamic layer on legato articulations, which is actually better for solo instruments. The less crossfades you do, the less phasing artifacts you get.
This unique dynamic layer contains all the musicality and emotion you will ever need. The recipe: slight crescendo-diminuendos, some progressive vibrato, and voilà. It just works.

With Trailer Guitars 2 you get that instant satisfaction of getting the sound you're craving for with zero effort and zero knowledge. It can go from clean and angelic to distorted and hellish in a second.

Multisampled, multitracked.

The big player of Trailer Guitars 2 is the Multisamples. We recorded 13 different articulations in mono, twice. This allows you to pan each one of the recording sets to L and R independently. The result: A breathtaking stereo sound out of the box. You can even control both of the channels volume and pan independently.

The simplest of loops.

We recorded a huge set of "simple loops". These are basic and generic sequences that are very commonly played on backing electric guitars, which are specially useful for adding some organic movement to your tracks.

It’s your space laboratory, your mix fixer, and your utility tool. It’s simple, flexible – and most importantly, it sounds out of this world.

* THREE DIMENSIONS: RAUM’s three modes cover everything from realistic rooms to experimental reflections and sonic space-travel sound design. Whether you’re adding depth to your pads, or want to extract high-fidelity textures from a one-shot sample, it has you covered.
* GROUNDED: This room-style reverb covers everything from tiny ambiences to large chambers, and delivers bucketloads of in-your-face reflections with a dense reverb tail. It’s perfect for adding weight and polish to percussive sounds, but can really take sounds to their limits with a little experimentation.
* AIRY: A hall-style reverb with natural early reflections that will elevate vocals, smooth-out synths, and swell pianos. The modulation control adds extra movement to the reverb, turning sounds from lush to freaky at the twist of a knob.
* COSMIC: Your zero-gravity sonic laboratory. Get busy with the pre-delay section to craft everything from complex resonances to granular textures, and metallic sounds, and take things further with the modulation knob for even wilder soundscapes. Cosmic is reverb reinvented.
* RAUM TO EXPERIMENT: RAUM’s pre-delay and modulation sections are where it makes the leap from the utilitarian to sound-sculpting experimentalism.
* PRE-DELAY: RAUM’s pre-delay section is packed with potential, with an enormous spectrum of potential uses. Increase the feedback using a short delay for metallic, comb-filter sounds, and sync it for echo or looping style effects
* MODULATION: Add a shifting, detuned feel to RAUM’s reverb tails, or go all-out in the Cosmic mode for wonky atmospheric soundscapes and unique granular textures.\

Musicians

Nashville is home to some of the finest musicians in the world.  Top players from all over the country have come to be a part of Nashville’s music scene, including the orchestras. Nashville Scoring Strings features half section sized of 8 violins, 6 violas, 5 celli, 4 basses.

Studio

Ocean Way Studio A has become lauded for its unique sound.  Established in an old church, the room has a well defined early reflection and highly controlled ambiance.  Its flexible, yet large 3-D sound makes it an ideal venue for string sampling.

Performance

We approached sampling Nashville Strings through actual performance-based phrases.  All of the short articulations were sourced from real repetitions, and the legatos were captured from actual melodies.  The result is a stellar level of fluidity and musical expressiveness.

All of the major articulations are included in Nashville Scoring Strings and were painstakingly recorded. Featuring legato, spiccato, pizzicato, marcato, trills, tremolo, col legno, all with an extreme level of detail and precision. 
Every articulation was sampled from a musical performance. The spiccato, pizzicato, and col legnos were sourced from true repetitions and have an unmatched fluidity. 

“The performative quality of this library shines through the polished surface, at times making it feel as though you are actually in the studio working with the musicians.”

Tone

We captured an extensive set of playing styles from plucks, picks, and taps to brushes, harmonics and sticks. Most unique styles were sampled both tonally and atonally, all with an emphasis on rhythmic performance. The resulting sounds are unique and well suited to film score.

Interface

description = """A good sounding reverb that reduces mudiness by removing clashing harmonics as you move from one note or chord to another. Here is the introductory text from the web site.

ADAPTIVERB  is a revolutionary reflectionless reverberation plugin. Unlike traditional reflection-based acoustic room modeling, ADAPTIVERB adds perceived depth, harmonic richness, and butter-smooth tails without obscuring the source. Preserving the tonal definition and directness of your mix, it adds size, glue and body – making it perfect for mixing and mastering applications alike.
Powered by ray tracing, source separation, and advances in artificial intelligence, ADAPTIVERB automatically adapts to the input audio like a chameleon, blending with your sounds perfectly, and conforming its reverb tail to the tonality of the input or a user defined set of notes.
While exceptionally fast to use, its advanced synthesis, cross-filtering and reverb pitch processing functionality provides ambient artists, film composers and sound designers with exciting new creative options for making evolving drones, organic pads, lush ambient sound scapes, and more.

Supports VST 2.x, VST 3.x, AU, RTAS and AAX Native on Mac And PC"""

This effect is anywhere between a vocoder and a synth with sharp filter-sweeps.
It can use input audio for its timbre to act as a vocoder ("audio" mode) or use a spectrum which you can draw precisely with the mouse, allowing extremely sharp cutoffs. You can shift this timbre up or down based on pitch, velocity, or a per-note envelope ("sweep").
In "audio" mode, you can control how much audio is used to calculate the timbre (window) and how often (overlap). There is a zero-latency mode for live performance, and a latency-compensated one. The "Volume" section acts like a basic compressor - turn both dials to 0 to disable.
The "fixed" mode lets you draw the spectrum for a single pulse of the oscillator using the mouse. Shift-click lets you draw straight lines.\
