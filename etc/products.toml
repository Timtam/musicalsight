The 1990 Studio Grand Piano is amongst one of our favorite virtual instruments ever done. This extraordinary library contains over 48.000 samples and unique microphones/positions, including Neumann 87’s, Coles, Neve SE Ribbon’s, AKG 414’s and Neumann KM 184’s. Everything was lovingly recorded & processed at a famous hi-tech British Studio through one of the greatest custom NEVE desks in existence. \r
\r
We wanted to create a hyper-realistic virtual instrument that pays an homage to its counter-part in reality – the incredibly versatile and studio defacto, Yamaha C7. The piano is best described as incredibly versatile and fantastic for pop, rock, classical, fusion and all in-between. The sustain samples were carefully crafted at both pedal up and pedal down positions. We also have bonus sampled staccato and staccatissimo notes (w/round robin each), so you have the correct attack for faster runs. In addition, the library gives you full control over the dynamic response as well as mechanics and tone, so you can dial in the perfect sound & dynamic match for your workflow – all simply done with a click of the mouse. We also included full control over resonance, room tone and signal chain noise, non-tonal key control, unique release triggers for hammer action, string damping, and release triggers for our room and ambient microphones. In essence you have everything right at your fingertips and most importantly – it just works effortlessly."""

Starting with the Violins, this newly reworked volume brings you the latest improvements in programming and workflow previously found only in our critically acclaimed Century Series. The update includes the familiar and easy to use Century interface, remastered articulations, a powerful articulation matrix, integrated mixing capabilities, and for advanced real-time processing, our Chaos Effects.\r
\r
With the new advanced Articulation browser, you can create your very own matrix of custom playing styles to suit your compositional needs. You can easily balance each articulation and assign each style its own dedicated Key-switch or Midi CC. Whether you are building a template and need to separate the long and short articulations; building performance-based patches out of the dozens of playing styles; or creating a custom set of patches needed for your specific arrangement, Adagio gives you the power to shape this iconic sound to your workflow.\r
\r
Say goodbye to Multis. With the update to Adagio, you will find various remastered layered Legato articulations made from 11 independent styles of lyrical Legato.\r
\r
These Legatos have been completely reworked and redesigned to make expressive string writing completely effortless. The new legatos now adapt to the way you play, a softer velocity will trigger a more passionate set of Legato transitions, whereas playing more intensely triggers Legatos with a stronger transition.\r
\r
The Adagio series was recorded in a beautiful church environment and contains three main groups of master violinists: Full Ensemble Violins (11 Players), Small Ensemble or Chamber Violins (3 Players) and a Solo Virtuoso Violinist (1 Player). Each section was sampled to capture the raw emotions and true expression within each string ensemble. Every articulation has been extensively sampled, including a total of 11 individual legato techniques, each with up to three times round robin, and a wealth of dynamic short notes including multiple styles of Spiccato. Each articulation is sampled with movement and character; the natural expression in each sample makes for a truly authentic playing experience that will be instantly noticeable in your next production."""

8Dio Aura Guitars is the ultimate collection of deep-sampled motion picture guitars.  Aura Guitars contains 12 different guitars, including Martin, 12 String, Dobro, Mandolin, Ukulele, 8 String Schecter, Silent Guitar, Stratocaster, Telecaster, Les Paul and assortment of Bass Guitars. It contains both multi-sampled single notes and multi-sampled chords. All the chords were sampled in perfect fifth, so you can essentially generate any chord and rhythm you want. All 12 guitars were sampled symmetrically – meaning that you can freely blend anything you want and it will work together. So you literally have billions of patch combinations.\r
\r
Aura Guitars contains 3 modules, so you can freely mix and blend up to three different guitars together. The collection spans over 9GB of content (lossless compressed from 17GB) and several thousand auras. Aura Guitars also contains an advanced grid-sequencer, which allows you to completely create your own signature rhythms by using velocity, pan, pitch and on/off functions for each step in the Aura. All the guitars were also multi-sampled, so when you play chords you can freely mix between muted/non-tonal strums and glide into rich, open chords by using the modwheel. In addition we also multi-sampled the single notes, so you can create more realistic sounding guitar rhythms.\r
\r
Aura Guitars is designed for instant gratification. It is insanely easy to use and get inspired – and it also allows you to go incredibly deep and even into the realm of chaos. We created chaos features both both patches, grid-sequencing and FX. So with one click the library can generate a completely new patch – with one click it can generate a completely new grid-sequence and with one click it can randomize all the FX. In essence you have an infinite amount of combinations and it just makes the library a true inspiration to work with."""

\r
Aura Tonal Exotic Studio Percussion contains 3 microphone positions (Close, Mid, Room) that each have a very distinct sound. We’ve also included a new dual layered FX system. The first part is our front-face FX system that gives you control over dynamics, filters, pitch and micro-pitch, delay, bit-resolution and our new textural convolution delay. The new textural delay allows you to take and use them as delay components, so the instrument will delay other sounds than just itself. We’ve also included our new Chaos FX engine, which gives you a large control over things such as EQ, Distortion, Stereo-Delay and an additional convolution reverb.\r

Intimate Studio Woodwinds is the latest creation in our series of contemporary studio ensembles. With over 160 hours of session material recorded at Scotland’s Premiere Recording Studio, Gorbals Sound, Intimate Studio Woodwinds continues our concept of a completely modular ensemble. The library features five highly expressive solo woodwind players, a Flute, Oboe, Cor Anglais, Clarinet, and Bass Clarinet. Each player was recorded in isolation, but all at the same time, so you can fluidly switch between any instrument and any articulation without compromising the sound or timing of your music. \r
\r
The sound of the ensemble is easily customizable with the wealth of options in the advanced user-interface. Each instrument also allows for extreme control over the stereo image with individual volume, panning, output routing, and the new distance control, which enables you to freely blend between a direct signal and a more spacious and ambient microphone position. \r
\r
Intimate Studio Woodwinds contains a vast collection of 26 articulations covering everything you need to create authentic-sounding woodwind melodies. Each articulation is sorted into four main categories (Traditional, Arcs, Performance, and Effects), making them all quickly and easily accessible from the built-in browser. The advanced user interface allows you to load and unload the articulations of your choosing, so you only have to load the sounds you need for your project. The Legatos are incredibly agile and can play almost anything you throw at them."""

These skins can be stretched or loosened with a tightening mechanism made up of either interwoven ropes, or nuts and bolts, which subtly alters the pitch of the drum.

In contemporary Punjabi music, dhols with synthetic, or plastic treble skins are very common. \r

The Aurora Choir is an elegant and powerful choir sample library for Kontakt, and represents somewhat of a milestone for Aria Sounds, being the culmination of many hours of work, study and tweaking.\r

The library contains both Sopranos and Altos (separate instruments for maximum control), and has an absolutely stunning legato tone. On top of this, it has short syllables, arranged into a very conveniently playable sequencer. Simple arrange your phrase in the sequence, and play away - the choir will automatically sing the syllables you enter.\r
\r
Multiple Legato Modes at Multiple Dynamics\r
\r
The choir contains four true legato modes (ah, eh, ih and oh) sampled at multiple dynamic layers, giving a total of EIGHT true sampled legato sets, for absolute realism and variation. On top of this, there are a total of twenty four different syllable shorts, sequence-able in the GUI, each sampled at three dynamic layers, giving a total of 72 variations per short note!"""

As there is a smooth gradient from bottom to top in terms of dynamic layers (see curve below), dragging the entire velocity data of the track up and down will completely transform the performance, as opposed to just moving the MIDI data through a few dynamic layers, and primarily relying on simply lowering and raising the volume of certain samples.

After much recording, production, tireless testing, re-testing and finally refining the end result, we are very happy to bring you the complete Master Solo Woodwinds bundle, which contains meticulously sampled solo flute, piccolo, oboe, clarinet and bassoon sampled Kontakt instruments (will work in Kontakt 4 and all higher versions - but not the free Kontakt "player").\r
\r
True Legato\r
\r
Multiple sets of true legato intervals were recorded both with and without vibrato, for the ultimate in realistic sounding performance.\r
\r
Trills/Tremolos\r
\r
Select this articulation, and you can play a trill or tremolo between any two notes by holding them down on the keyboard (up to seven notes apart/a perfect fifth). See the video demo below for a demonstration of this.\r
\r
Key Noises\r
\r
These woodwind instruments owe part of the character of their sound to the mechanics of the instrument, so we decided to come up with something that allows some form of control over this subtle characteristic in timbre. What we ended up with was a knob that can control the level of mechanical noise that is audible from the instrument. You can turn this up, or off completely in the GUI to set the average level that seems right, and it will then, on top of this, react to the velocity of your own playing, much like it would a real player pressing harder or softer.\r
\r
Please note, as vibrato on the Clarinet is not a standard technique, we have not included it, but the other four instruments all include vibrato legato as WELL as non vibrato legato and sustains, all at multiple crossfade-able dynamic layers (MIDI CC1/Mod Wheel).\r
You are even able to control the level/volume of the key sounds/mechanics of the instruments, and the sound of the flautist pressing the keys will also be louder depending on how hard you press the key on your MIDI keyboard (velocity).\r
\r
One feature we are exceptionally proud of is the intuitive trills articulation system, which allows you to play any trill/tremolo within the flute's playable range up to a perfect fifth (seven chromatic notes)... See the demo video for an insight in to how this works!\r

With an instrument as diverse, capable, and exposed as the violin, there is no cutting corners, so we strived to capture as much of the possible sounds a violin can make as possible, resulting in the huge list of articulations you can see below, as well as four sampled legato styles, also shown below. We even specially sampled slurred and bowed legato so you can correctly and realistically phrase passages, and a specially sampled "fast legato" set of intervals, which will allow you to play virtuosic runs and scale passages.\r
\r
On top of this, we want our instruments to be as close in sonic-flexibility to a real situation as they can be, so in addition to providing close and stage mic positions, we have also made sure to have both a ribbon and condenser mic, which you can choose to switch between. Both sounds offer so much in their own right, the ribbon having a beautiful smooth tone, and the condenser being ruthless in exposing every little detail in the sound.\r
\r
The stereo mic position can be widened and narrowed by dragging the mics in the interface.\r
\r
We wanted to make this instrument even more musical, so we have once again used our idea of the "phrase builder", which allows you to select the attack, or beginning sound of a phrase, and then switch around the type of legato throughout a musical phrase.\r
\r
One huge give-away that an instrument is a sampled one and not a real instrument is how the beginning of every musical phrase sounds the same. A great performer will not sound like this. They will vary the phrase beginnings, and perhaps start some quietly, some with an FP, some with a stutter, and so we have included five options for this, to ensure that your compositions sound evolving, musical, and extremely convincing.\r
\r
The width of the stereo mic perspective can be changed by dragging the bottom pair of microphones in the interface, and dynamics can be brought up and down by either the mod wheel or expression Midi CC - depending on whether you have MOD or EXP selected in the bottom right hand corner of the instrument GUI, and the shorts' dynamics are controlled by velocity.\r
\r
Four True-sampled Legato Styles\r
\r
We spent a while tackling how to approach allowing the user to play both slow more drawn out passages, and then also being able to create realistic renditions of more virtuosic, fast passages, and eventually came up with a very intricate technique which allows both.\r
\r
We sampled these intervals completely differently, and set it up so you can switch between these depending on whether you are playing fast or not. So for the faster legato, you can switch to "fast" with the legato keyswitching, and play intervals up to and including a minor third in your scales and runs, maintaining a very realistic sound. The sound of the note transitions on a violin when playing fast is completely different from the sound when playing slower, and both are captured and skilfully programmed into this instrument.\r
\r
Types of Legato\r
\r
* Slurred Legato - switching note with the finger only, without changing bow direction... the smoothest legato sound.\r
* Bowed Legato - changing the bow at the note change. A more noticeable interval. (slurred and bowed legato are both essential in obtaining a realistic and well phrased performance)\r
* Portamento Legato - a subtle slide between notes.\r
* Fast Legato - Specially sampled intervals which allow you to play fast runs/scales with intervals up to a minor third between each note - something seriously lacking and rarely possible with most sample libraries.\r
\r
ARTICULATION LIST\r
\r
* Normal Sustain\r
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)\r
* Crescendo\r
* FP (loud then suddenly quiet with a crescendo back up)\r

We are proud to present Octohorn, the first release from our brass series, with an eight-player French Horn ensemble, boasting no less then seven mic positions, with the aims of giving you absolute and ultimate control over your soundscape.\r
\r
This instrument was created with the intentions of producing something in a completely new league of sonic sculpt-ability, able to sit in a track with the depth and spread of a real ensemble recording. We have achieved this through multiple new and innovative features, including the seven mic positions, carefully set to cover the whole soundscape, recorded chords and octaves to minimize "sample layering" in tracks, which kills the depth of a track, and much more...\r
\r
Mix between the perspectives; Decca tree sides and mid, flanks, room, woodwind spots (see more about this below!), close ribbons and close LDCs, with the flexibility aimed at replicating a real scoring session. Now you have control over the different mic and perspective levels in the session, enabling you to morph your own sound in your scores, as if you were at the studio with the console at your fingertips.\r
\r
You might have noticed that one of the perspectives included is "woodwind spots". While this is not a woodwind library, the mics that spot the woodwinds were set up and included in the recording. The reason for this, is that a lot of the brass sound bleeds heavily into the woodwind mics in scoring sessions, adding to the perceived depth of the sound, so whilst pushing to achieve the most versatile, we felt that this absolutely had to be included.\r
\r
Three True-sampled Legato Styles\r
\r
The instrument comes with three true legato modes - a normal slurred legato, a sample octave legato, and a fast legato, for faster passages,which will allow you to play virtuoso runs and scale passages.\r
\r
The reason we included octave sustains and legato, is because when you play octaves by layering the same instrument twice, what you are hearing is no longer a real octave passage, but two sets of the exact same horns, in the exact same position, layered on top of one another. When an ensemble plays real octave, every note has it's own sonic space and position in hall, and therefore in the perceived depth/stereo field, and you lose this by layering samples. For this reason, we recorded octave sustains and legato specially for a completely true and real sound. \r
\r
Not only did we just record the octaves, we recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... again for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples. With this instrument, you can achieve that real spacious sound.\r
\r
Full list of articulations:\r
\r
* No Legato (allows polyphonic playing)\r
* Legato - normal slurred legato (piano and forte dynamic layers crossfade-able)\r
* Oct Legato - True octave legato\r
* Fst Legato - Fast legato specially for fast playing\r
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)\r
* Chords < - Crescendo major, minor and open 5th chords\r
* Chords > - Diminuendo major, minor and open 5th chords\r
* Staccato - Short notes, with up to 5RR per dynamic layer (three layers)\r

Music composition and production is constantly evolving, and the tools used to create music need to evolve along with this. The concept for this library involved capturing colours from a string orchestra which have not yet been recorded for any sample library, and place them at your fingertips, ready to compose and perform with.\r
\r
Angel Strings Vol.1 Includes textural elements, morphing into/out from atonality, risers/divebombs ideal for building tension (for example in trailer music), different styles of spiccato/staccato, marcato to soft attacks with sustains, fast tempo-locked tremolo for powerful driving string hooks and more...\r
\r
The techniques and articulations available in Angel Strings Vol.1 were cleverly recorded with the entire string orchestra in the same room all at once, in a way that seamlessly blends from the bottom of the range (double basses) to the highest violin notes. You can play the entire orchestra with each articulation across a single keyboard with a single NKI, making this library perfect for anything from merely sketching your ideas out on a full keyboard range - to easily executing unique parts for your final compositions.\r
\r
THE STUDIOANGEL STUDIOS\r
This library was recorded at Angel Studios in London, where countless pop/rock stars have recorded (notably Adele's "21"), and many major film and video game scores have been recorded, including The Lion King, Jackie, Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Horizon: Zero Dawn and many more...\r
\r
Angel Strings Vol.1 is another collaboration between Auddict and the fantastic "United Strings of Europe", a London-based ensemble made up of young professionals from across the European Union and Switzerland with the goal of promoting musical and cultural cooperation at the highest level.\r
\r
The ensemble is gaining recognition for its exciting performances in Switzerland, France, Lebanon and the UK. With several world premieres of works by Hristic, Marinkovic and Winkler, the ensemble has collaborated with a number of distinguished artists including Hildegarde Fesneau, Marc Benzekri, Mateja Marinkovic, Jack Liebeck, Walter Delahunt and Ljubisa Jovanovic.\r

Because bigger is better than big, Cerberus offers a state-of-the-art functionality for stacking drums. We recorded the triple amount of round robins, so you could stack up to 3 different layers. That gives you 18 simultaneous sounding drums! You can even add timing/pan variation to each hit to make it sound looser/broader.\r

Each loop additionally has the low, mid, and high stems laid out on the keyboard, allowing you to layer stems to create your own combinations. For a TV or library composer who writes lots of underscore, these loops are going to be incredible time savers.\r

Two top-quality hybrid pianos in one instrument, for the ultimate in depth and versatility. Gravitas morphs between an orchestral grand and a synthetic piano engineered by top sound designers, while Red Planet layers in electric guitar for out-of-this-world tones.\r
\r
Lush, spacious, and rich in tone, Klavier is a versatile, top-quality hybrid and underscore piano instrument that is incredibly easy to use. At the core of Klavier, we have two instruments: The first, our Gravitas Piano, allows you to morph between a deeply sampled orchestral grand piano, and synthetic piano sound design created by some of the top trailer composers and sound designers out there. The second, our Red Planet Piano, allows you to morph between our deeply sampled orchestral grand and electric guitar sound design layers. With this wide range of sonic possibilities, Klavier serves as an incredibly useful instrument for a wide range of music.\r
\r
Gravitas Piano (Piano meets Sound Design).\r
\r
AUDIO IMPERIA's “Klavier" is the first instrument in our new “Private Stock Instruments” series. Originally intended as a private sample library for a group of trailer composers, the two instruments in this series combine the very best of the worlds of raw/organic recordings and post-production/sound design. The goal throughout the whole project was to start with the user experience and the raw sound and to work our way backwards to a final product that is both versatile and instantly inspiring.\r
The Gravitas Piano was designed specifically for trailer music. A piano that can cut through in a big and epic mix, yet still retain a lot of warmth and depth. To achieve this, we used a set of six stereo microphones and then combined these with their corresponding sound-designed (“Synthetic”) counterparts in post production.\r
\r
Organic Piano: Yamaha Baby Grand Piano\r
\r
* 2x Brauner Phantom Classic Front End Audio Microphones (above the piano)\r
* 2x DPA 4011A Cardioid Microphones (below the piano)\r
* 2x Neumann KM184 Small-diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphones (above the keys, one on each side of the player)\r
* 2x Neumann U87 Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphones (inside the lid)\r
* 2x Coles 4038 Ribbon Microphones (inside the lid)\r
* 2x Earthworks QTC40 Small-diaphragm Omnidirectional Condenser Microphones (room)\r
\r
The Gravitas Piano comes with 35 “Synthetic” presets, made by some of the best producers in the trailer industry. These “Synthetic” presets can be accessed via the preset control on the “Synthetic” side of the piano. The “Organic” piano offers both Sustained and Staccato articulations. All of the “Synthetic” presets were made using the original samples from the “Organic” piano. No synthesizers or other instruments were used, just pure sound manipulation and sound design.\r

\r
Red Planet Piano (Piano meets Electric Guitar).\r
\r
The “Red Planet Piano” was heavily inspired by the movie adaptation of Andy Weir’s “The Martian”. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is absolutely amazing and inspired us to create an “outer space” version of the Klavier. \r
The Red Planet Piano shares the same organic sample pool used for the Gravitas Piano. But to get that particular “outer space” electric guitar sound, we created a number of complex guitar sounds. They are designed to match that lush and wide sound that you need to evoke that feeling of depth and space. This, combined with the organic piano, creates a truly unique sound.\r
We used a blend of the neck (humbucker) and the split-coil (single coil) position of the very limited Ibanez JPM90HAM. A perfect blend of the single coil twang and directness and the warmth and depth of the neck humbucker. The initial recordings were done direct and we then reamped the recordings through various amp and fx signal chains."""

* GROUNDED: This room-style reverb covers everything from tiny ambiences to large chambers, and delivers bucketloads of in-your-face reflections with a dense reverb tail. It’s perfect for adding weight and polish to percussive sounds, but can really take sounds to their limits with a little experimentation.\r

* RAUM TO EXPERIMENT: RAUM’s pre-delay and modulation sections are where it makes the leap from the utilitarian to sound-sculpting experimentalism.\r
* PRE-DELAY: RAUM’s pre-delay section is packed with potential, with an enormous spectrum of potential uses. Increase the feedback using a short delay for metallic, comb-filter sounds, and sync it for echo or looping style effects\r

Performance\r
\r
We approached sampling Nashville Strings through actual performance-based phrases.  All of the short articulations were sourced from real repetitions, and the legatos were captured from actual melodies.  The result is a stellar level of fluidity and musical expressiveness.\r

* Newly remapped and integrated into our new orchestral engine\r
* Now includes Legato Sordino (previously an optional addition)\r
* Greater Legato range and flexibility (more exposed transitions for cleaner Legatos)\r
* Independent real-time control of Legato, Portamento, and Glissando speeds\r
* All section divisis integrated on the same patch (no more need for multis)\r
* Integrated polyphonic Legato (no more need for multis)\r
* Integrated Stage and Color profiles (no more need for multis)\r
* Same note rebow – integrated into new patches and auto divisi aware\r
\r
LASS is our famous original 60-piece multi-instrument divisi string library, painstakingly developed by recording three different divisi sections (¼ + ¼ + ½ section at a time) on a trusted scoring stage, for unprecedented individual control of each section. We have also recorded First Chair players so you can layer them with the sections or use them as soloists. From the delicate tones of a divisi section playing Sustains and beautiful Legatos, to the power of Staccatos and Spiccatos and everything in between, LA Scoring Strings 3 captures the broad expressive range and diversity of the orchestral string family while providing the flexibility to create smaller intimate section sounds. Pristine recordings and meticulous editing ensure every note of your music will shine.\r

Pattern Strings offers a unique approach to ostinatos by providing a collection of tempo-synced rhythmic fragments.\r
These 19 rhythms have been recorded at two dynamic layers on violin, viola, cello, and bass, with 4 round robins.\r
The interface utilizes an intuitive drag and drop mechanic which allows you to arrange the rhythms into sequences in which all the rhythms flow together with natural phrasing and musicality.\r
\r
You can Drag and Drop rhythms in the center to either of the pattern strips. If you want to change the order of the rhythms you can do that too, by dragging them around.\r
\r
With Legato turned on, new notes start sync-ed with previous held notes. This way it's possible to create convincing lines by changing notes according to the rhythms, as seen in the demos.\r
\r
Pattern Strings has an Automatic Bow Direction feature. It plays downbow samples on downbeats and upbow samples on upbeats, which creates a natural ebb and flow between beats.\r
\r
The Tempo Sync switch allows you to set the sample playback to half speed or double speed.\r
Some of the samples were recorded at 90bpm, and others at 80bpm. So, let's say you're working at 160bpm. This would mean that the 90bpm samples would be time stretched to twice their original speed! To make up for this, you could use the Tempo Sync option to set the speed to be half as fast.\r
\r
All the combinations of instruments have been rendered down, both single and with stereo doubling. This makes it possible to layer instruments together without so much memory and cpu.\r
\r
Because Pattern Strings contains 8.32GB of samples, the interface was designed with a Dynamic Loading system so that it only loads what you need. In order to make it more efficient, combinations of instruments have been rendered together, saving on voice count and memory. This way if all instruments are enabled, it will use the same amount of memory and CPU as if only one instrument was enabled.\r
\r
Beef up the sound of an instrument by turning on Doubling. Stereo-doubled samples have been rendered down, so turning this on won't increase the number of voices or memory needed.\r
\r
Say you're using Pattern Strings on a track, and you have a couple of different variations you want to use at different parts of the track. Rather than opening up multiple instances, you could save variations into Custom Keyswitches.\r
Just click “Map”, then click on one of the colored keys at the very bottom of the keyboard, and Voilà, the current pattern can now be recalled by that key!\r
\r
Generate a sequence of rhythms using the Random Button, and perhaps you will find something useful."""

Sospiro Strings is a Kontakt library for creating slow, emotive strings. It features 4 different length swells and 3 sustained articulations, recorded on bass, cello, viola, and violin.\r
\r
There are separate nki's for each individual instrument, and there is an nki with all instruments mixed together, to work as a simpler sketching tool, and also to save memory.\r
There are 2 varieties of Swells:\r
\r
* The vibrato swells are provide a warm, individual sound. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option. All of the swells were originally recorded at 110 BPM\r
* The non-vibrato swells have a clear tone which especially brings attention to the change in tone as each instrument louder and softer.\r
Each version, Vibrato and non-vibrato has a single velocity layer. \r
\r
Using the Length in Beats slider, you can choose the appropriate length, and the corresponding swell will be chosen and time-stretched if needed.\r
The Length Multiplier is useful if you have a project with a fast bpm and you want it to sound slow, or vice versa.\r
The Smart Release feature makes it so that however far into the crescendo-ing part of the sample you have held the note, it will jump that far from the end of the swell. This means that the longer you hold a note, the longer its release will be.\r
All of the swells can be either vibrato or non-vibrato. The vibrato adds warmth and individuality to the sound, but may be a bit over dramatic in some cases. The non-vibrato has a lot of clarity, and especially brings attention to change in tone as each instrument gets louder and softer. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option.\r
The Sync feature is one of the most essential features: with Sync enabled, any notes you add or change in a chord will sync with the first note that was played.\r
There are 3 varieties of Sustains:\r
\r
* The cold sustains are played with a slow bow and no vibrato --a fragile sound at the edge of breaking.\r
* The warm sustains are played over the fingerboard with a fast, freely changing bow and generous vibrato.\r
* The full sustains are played closer to the bridge with a slow, heavy bow. Vibrato is used with discretion.\r
\r
There is an option to double the sound, which layers two instances together and pans them slightly apart. This sounds better if you are only using one instrument by itself and only playing a few notes at a time. If you are playing big chords and layering all 4 instruments together, the doubled feature tends to sound more generic and uninteresting."""

String Flow Cello samples a technique string players use, in which they quickly roll the bow across the strings to create an energetic, chordal texture.\r
There are 2 ways to play the instrument.\r
The first way is simple: just choose what type of chord you want, what key to be in, and then play on the white keys. Whatever you play will pick a harmony which will fit into whatever key you've chosen. It's kind of like the "Harmonize" factory scripts in Kontakt, except that in this case, all of the harmonies had to be manually recorded!\r
The second way to play requires more knowledge of the instrument, and is more flexible. If you play a chord that has been recorded, the instrument will play that chord on viola.\r
The midi clips which come with the instrument demonstrate which chords work.\r
\r
* The interface reacts to notes played, displaying what the music notation would look like to the player, and also showing which voicing, inversion, and key the chord is in. This could be an educational for those looking to write music for live musicians.\r
* Comes with a collection of midi clips to introduce the instrument. These include a collection of short progressions, and examples of all the possible voicings.\r
* Each chord was played for 4 measures (about 9 seconds). Loops are enabled for all samples.\r
* Automatically tempo-syncs to project tempo. The samples were recorded at 100BPM. 85 - 160BPM sounds good, and the optimal tempo is 120BPM.\r
* Chords are organized into 4 different types of voicings. Closed spacing, open spacing, 7th chords, and open 5ths.\r
* The closed spacing chords were recorded in both major and minor, and in all 3 inversions. The 7th chords include a dominant 7th, minor 7th, and major 7th voicing.\r
* Except for the open 5ths voicings, each chord recorded at 2 velocity layers, and each velocity layer has a normale version and a ponticello version, which can be crossfaded between using the modwheel. This is a good way to add motion to the sound.\r
* The louder velocity layer has rubato which adds contrast, and brings out the bassline."""

The most detailed sampled Chromatic Harmonica on the planet\r
\r
Play harmonica like Stevie Wonder or Toots Thielemans - but on your MIDI-keyboard.\r
With almost 7.000 samples, 14 articulations, up to 8 dynamic-layers and a full range of 4 octaves, CH-Harmonica is definitely the most detailedly sampled Chromatic Harmonica on the planet. The user interface holds tons of features on several pages to shape the sound the way you want it. However, if you do not feel like editing, just play and explore the 26 pre-programmed Key-Switch presets ranging from A-1 to A#1 on the lower keys of your MIDI-keyboard.\r
To achieve the feeling of a live performance, the user interface offers four "Dynamic Modes", „Key-Vibrato“, „Hot-Keys“ and a revolutionary new concept of articulation presets .\r
One of the most unique features in CH-Harmonica are the Phase-Aligned samples. After six months of research, Chris Hein found a solution to phase-synchronize the samples. This enables an absolutely perfect blending between six dynamic layers.\r
During the development of CH-Harmonica, most attention was spent on how to work with dynamic expression.\r

The Player\r
\r
We were very happy when Berthold Matschat gave us permission to sample his rare harmonica. There are very few chromatic harmonica players worldwide, and he is the leading player in Germany. Berthold Matschat is also an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. Since he extensively works with sampled instruments in his own studio, he had a detailed concept of what needed to be played on and sampled of the harmonica.\r
His tone is particularly soulful and emotional. We recorded an old rare Hohner Harmonica, that dates back to those times, when Hohner could impress with the words “Made in Germany”.\r

The Cosmic Darkness\r
\r
A journey into the future of sound turned dark and gritty fast. In Best Service - Dark Horizon, by Sonuscore, Elysion’s famous ensemble engine has been hijacked, augmented, and vaporized. With the drifting cosmic remains, Dark Horizon molds the future into a dystopian atmosphere of massive basses, cosmic arps, and drifting pads. Turn simple chords into unreal, nightmarish space-scapes, while moving the mod-wheel bends time and transports you into the dark, disparate corners of eldritch furies.\r
\r
* Experience the diversity of 80 instantly playable, bass-heavy instruments.\r
* Experience the infinite depth of over 1.2GB of sample content.\r
* Experience the flexibility of 180 complex animated and fully customizable themes.\r
\r
Dark Horizon is an earth-shattering bass-heavy synth built using synthesizers and a variety of sounds bent and warped into fascinating soundscapes and powerful low ends. Dark Horizon is built from the same engine as ELYSION, creating an even darker sound palette with new presets, themes, and effects. \r
\r
For Extraordinary and Dark Bass Sound\r
\r
With a focus on dark, dirty bass sounds, Dark Horizon pushes levels and tones not yet explored by the Elysion series. Space engineer Tobias Menguser sent wavs into the far reaches of the cosmos, beyond the known universe, where only the terrifying nightmares and figments of reality lurk. In those unknown places, the sounds were twisted and experimented upon, crafting a full sound palette of dark and low basses. They mutated into growling instruments, screaming oscillations, and ground-shaking subs.\r
For Modern Producers and Score Composers\r
For ambient, modern electronic, and experimental music, Dark Horizon can bring a new power into your work with its library of grinds and grooves. For scoring and blockbusters, these sounds make for perfect tension-building underscore.\r
Dark Horizon  - What´s Included?\r
As the deep underbelly of the Elysion series, Dark Horizon is a powerful Kontakt instrument that resynthesizes orchestral sounds and sound FX along with a great variety of rare analog synths and FX boxes. The resulting instruments are mind-crushing sounds, gut-wrenching themes, rhythmic arps, whirling pads, and a set of effects to push them even further beyond the imagination.\r
\r
* Ambient - Resynthesized - Cinematic - Dark Horizon pushes sounds into unrecognizable extremes, utilizing analogue rack effects and the dark powers of eldritch gods. Use Dark Horizon as a scoring tool for any project that needs a dose of profound bass and gritty depth or use it as a really exceptional synth to create innovative melodies with outstanding sonic power.\r
* Layered - Dirty - Powerful - With four layers of sounds and an onboard compressor, delay, and hall reverb, create unique and disturbing combinations for a truly original experience. Each layer is linked to an independent arpeggiator and two pan engines, allowing you to easily create complex, evolving pads.\r
* Sampling Redefined - Bursting with Expression and Variety - We recorded, sampled and produced the sounds, treating them like acoustic instruments. This results in an unimaginable dynamic and unprecedented sound. Integrated into the pathbreaking ensemble engine, Dark Horizon further expands our strongest composing lineup, together with Elysion 2 and The Orchestra.\r
Score the Dark with a Familiar User Interface\r
\r
Users of Elysion and The Orchestra will find Dark Horizon’s user interface familiar, with all the essential controls in the same places or intuitive to find.\r
\r
* Main Page - Select instruments, presets and control all layers from the main page. Play up to 4 instruments simultaneously.\r
* Ensemble Engine - Modify and perfect your sounds to the very last detail with the critically-acclaimed ensemble engine. Create exciting new sonic experiences by simply playing some chords.\r
* Mix Page - Mix & pan your layers and breathe live and dynamic variation into every single pattern.\r

\r
Powerful Features - Supernatural Workflow\r
\r
Dark Horizon features the critically acclaimed ensemble technology, empowering you to create complex sounds by playing simple chords.\r
\r
* Modified Ensemble Engine - Dark Horizon uses a modified version of the Elysion ensemble engine. This means you can play up to four different instrument modules at the same time, and each module allows independent controls for arpeggiators. Using the mod-wheel unlocks an astounding filter effect that produces a great number of kinetic, digital possibilities.\r
* Motion Engine - Dark Horizon comes with its own unique dynamic FX engine. It allows the fundamental customization of the instruments, e.g. steering attack or decay via Midi CC. Besides other FX the Motion Engine includes also two Pan Steppers, breathing live and variation into every pattern in no time.\r
\r

Unleash the power of the ensemble engine onto your personal template, change notes, combine different patterns and make them your own. Experience the incredible efficiency of Dark Horizon, Elysion 2 and The Orchestra merging together within your DAW.\r
\r
Maximize Your Creativity\r
\r
Dark Horizon comes with 180 complex animated and fully customizable themes, spread across five different categories. Each category has its unique style and purpose, providing you with either rhythmic elements, dark textures or sounds that are perfect for playing melodies.\r
\r
* Poly Animations - Complex rhythms for chords that push the audio floor with movement and vibration. The modwheel modifies the arps and filters, increasing the tension, while introducing horn blasts, braahms, and drones.\r
* Rhythmic Pulses - Low pulsing basses with complex arpeggiations reveal great dynamic range when the modwheel is pushed, morphing the rhythms and raising the filters.\r
* Mono Arpeggios - Legato arpeggios arranged in danceable grooves with the modwheel pressing the frequencies and creating a much sharper tone.\r
* Lowest Textures - Dark, tension-filled drones complimented by screeching impulses, filter swipes, and stellar reverb effects at the turn of the modwheel.\r
* Playable Sounds - Wide cosmic pads and gently gliding legatos, this set includes the bulk of the playable content. The modwheel releases all the built up anger and tension as the frequencies push.\r

Emotional Cello – never before, a virtual instrument could be played with this level of expression.\r
\r
The Emotional Cello from the Munich-based developers Harmonic Subtones is a virtual instrument that features a powerful and emotional sound and opens up unknown dimensions of expression.\r
Whether film scoring, pop music productions, songwriting, classical music or modern, avant-garde cello compositions, the Emotional Cello shines through a variety of contained articulations, a direct and unadulterated sound as well as unusual playing techniques and rebowing.\r
\r
Contextual Sampling\r
\r
"Contextual Sampling" is what the developers of Emotional Cello call the philosophy behind this project in which all samples are always recorded in a musical context to capture the natural bowing and expressiveness of real instrumentalists. In this approach the recordings of a real vibrato play an important role, as they are always more inspiring and organic than adding an artificial vibrato.\r
\r
Articulations, Patches & True Legato\r
\r
Emotional Cello was created from well over 100 articulations and their variants. By means of an elaborate and intelligent script, countless articulations are linked together in a meaningful way so that they follow the playing style of the user.\r
The library contains three master patches, including the "Emotional Cello", the "Sulponticello" and the "Harmonic Cello". These contain most of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. Three different transition types have been captured in several sessions and simulate, among other things, realistic changes in bowing direction or passionate portamento while playing. The user simply controls the velocity - the tempo of the tone transitions automatically adapts to your DAW!\r
In addition to the Master Patch, the Emotional Cello also contains an Individuals Patch which is a set of key switch patches with different articulations of the same category such as sustains, shorts, trills and more. The Specials Patch offers some unusual articulations and effects and the Stackable Patch contains the main articulations with standardized key switching to match the stackable patches of Emotional Violin & Emotional Viola.\r
\r
Selection of the included playing styles:\r
Spiccimo & frog, Stacc, Fast Spiccato, Frog Madness, Pizzicato, Delicate, Delicate fast, Proud Vibrato\r
Hero Vibrato, Martele half NV 8RR, Martele half Vib 4RR, Pickup, Fortepiano, Vivid, Paganini Run, Moderate 2, Sustain Non Vib XFDe, Expressive XFDe, Pastorale, Pastorale slow, Tremolo, Trill HAT,\r
Trill WT.\r
\r
Ornament Key Switches\r
\r
The Ornament Key Switches are another great feature. Unlike the articulation key switches, these are temporary and allow variations of the already selected articulation. By pressing one of the Ornament Key Switches, the current playing style can be faded into another articulation or variations can be generated. Last but not least, the Ornament MKS offer typical effects like glissando, flageolet and many more.\r
\r
The Effects\r
\r
In order to customize the sound of the Cello according to your wishes, you can use effects specially designed for the instrument. These include a 3-band EQ, a switchable sordino and a timbre function. The latter contains 15 convolution-based presets from renowned and experienced sound engineers for easy and characteristic modulation of the basic sound.\r
For the use of the Cello as 1st chair cello in an orchestral environment, there are also timbre EQs which place the viola in its correct position in the orchestra room. The final touch is provided by the "Room" and "Reverb" modules, which use professionally recorded convolution reverb presets to reproduce the sound of real rooms and can also be adjusted separately.\r
\r
You are the artist!\r
\r
The interface of the Emotional Cello has some advanced features to make it easier for you to play the library. For example, "PolyLegato" recognizes whether you are playing a bound melody line or a chord, and "Legato Trimming" allows you to manually adjust the speed of legato and portamento transitions.\r
The Attack function allows you to add an additional start sample independent of the currently selected articulation in order to let short notes flow in during legato playing or to simulate harsh starting notes. Correct tuning is also taken care of: Using the "Micro Tuning Option", the most popular tunings can be applied to the viola, and completely new tunings can be created.\r
\r
The Recording\r
\r
Emotional Cello was recorded in the Mastermix Studio near Munich, in a wood-panelled room with high ceilings and the greatest possible distance from the wall. For the greatest possible flexibility of use, two Neumann microphones, type KM184 and U87, were used for close recording. In this way, the room was kept quite subtle, and you can then create your desired sound with your own effects. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.\r

Emotional Violin - the most expressive virtual violin of all time\r
\r
If you are looking for the perfect instrument for film scoring, pop music, songwriting, classical or modern avant-garde violin compositions, the Emotional Violin is your first choice! A unique, virtual instrument that convinces through its variety of articulations, its direct and unadulterated sound and functions like True Legato and Rebowing. With its impressive and at the same time emotional sound, it enables expressions that have never been achieved before.\r
\r
Contextual Sampling\r
\r
Our philosophy during the recordings is called "Contextual Sampling". In order to find the perfect sound, several string instruments were sampled in various ways over a period of four years. We came to the conclusion that no technique comes even close to the actual and natural vibrato of a trained musician. The samples of true legato were always much more inspiring and had a more organic feel than added artificial legato. So our goal was to perfectly capture these musical aspects and combine them into a great sounding and easy to play instrument.\r
Emotional Violin consists of more than 100 articulations and their variations. Through elaborate, intelligent scripting countless articulations were usefully linked, so that they follow the user’s style of playing. This is the secret of Emotional Violin that makes for its exceedingly realistic and authentic sound.\r
\r
Master Patches & True Legato\r
\r
Emotional Violin contains three Master Patches, including „Emotional Violin“ and „Intimate Violin“. These contain a multitude of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. In total, 3 different transition types were captured in countless sessions, which perfectly simulate bow changes or passionate portamento, easily controlled via velocity. The speed of the transitions automatically matches your DAW’s tempo.\r
\r
Ornament Keyswitches\r
\r
A special highlight are the Ornament Keyswitches. Unlike the articulation keyswitches, these are designed for the moment, to bring variations into chosen articulations. This way you can blend from a current playing style to another one (e.g. trills and tremolos) or you can generate variations (e.g. bow changes, to smoothly end a note), just by pushing an Ornament Keyswitch (e.g. trills and tremolos). Last but not least the Ornament MKS offer typical violin-effects like glissando (up and down), flageolett and many more.\r
\r
Effective sound shaping\r
\r
Emotional Violin offers a small but mighty collection of sound shaping possibilities, specifically tailored to the instrument. Aside from a typical 3-band EQ and a connectable sordino you will find timbre functions.\r
4 famous and experienced sound engineers created these convolution based presets (so called\r
Timbre Impulses) that allow for an easy and characterful modulation of the violin sound. To use the violin as 1st Chair Violin in an orchestral arrangement, we added a timbre EQ that places the violin in the correct orchestral seating. The icing on the cake are modules „Room“ and „Reverb“, which provide the sound of actual rooms, thanks to professionally recorded convolution presets - plus they can be tweaked separately.\r
\r
You are the artist!\r
\r
To meet the requirements of your playing, Emotional Violin offers additional features. At „Poly Legato“, for example, it automatically recognises whether a bound melody line or an chord is played and via „Legato Trimming“ you can manually set the speed of legato and portamento transitions. A speciality represents the attack feature, which enables the user to add a start sample independent of the selected articulation - for instance to add short or harsh starting notes during legato. The correct tuning is also provided: via the „Micro Tuning Option“ you can apply established tunings to the violin (e.g. pythagorean, Werkmeister III, and many more) or create entirely new ones.\r
\r
The result is a library with unsurpassed authenticity\r
\r
Emotional Violin offers a multitude of articulations - also unusual ones - you won’t find in any other library. Aside from the 3 big Master Patches, you will find more than 70 articulations structured in categories and available as Multi-Keyswitch-Patches - from expressive sustains, to pinpoint shorts with up 9 Round Robins, to trills and exotic effects, to dynamic crossfades within four layers. You can deactivate unused playing styles / keyswitches at any time via the „Purge“ feature, freeing up working storage for other instruments. So if you prefer to not work exclusively with keyswitches, this method perfectly suits you.\r
Simply select from one of the following\r
Normal Sustains with and without Vibrato, Multiple Progressive Vibratos, Multiple Espressivo, Flautando, Sul Ponticello, Morbid Sustains, Harmonics, Multiple Spiccatos, Staccato, Marcato, Tremolo, Tremolo Sul Ponticello, Multiple Trills, Pizzicato, Pizzicato Snap, Paganini Pizzicato, Scratches, Piazolla FX, Diverse Violin Effekte, Violin Percussions\r
\r
The Recording\r
\r
The Emotional Violin was recorded at the Mastermix Studio near Munich in a wood-panelled room with a large ceiling height and at the greatest possible distance to the wall. For maximum flexibility, two Neumann KM184 and U87 microphones were used very closely. Therefore the room amount is quite subtle, so you can use your own effects for further processing. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.\r

This way, the combination of Mystica and Cantus forms an impressive tool to create overwhelming choir passages.\r
Mystica is an unparalleled choir with an extraordinary sound quality. Mystica offers an almost magical sound which is extraordinarily versatile and equally suited for esoteric and mystic melodies as well as for big cinematic passages. One of the benefits of Mystica is its wonderful, expressive „True Legato“.\r
\r
Mystica unifies realism and inspiration\r
\r
This unrivaled choir-library allows creating incredibly realistic choir-phrases with ease. Mystica's powerful and innovative wordbuilder combines 24 words in the form of 120 elements, consisting of full words, corresponding syllables and five True-Legato vowels (A, E, I, O, U) plus an additional “Mmmh“-articulation.\r
As every Tarilonte vocal-library, Mystica offers the brilliant and innovative option of combining each word with any of the five True-Legato vowels, too. This way, realistically sounding vocal phrases can be created without using ready-made phrases.\r
Nevertheless, Mystica can, of course, be used as a typical choir-library without its Phrase-Arranger. There is an ample choice of 100 Gregorian vocal phrases, allowing to create sacral atmospheres with ease. In addition, the library offers twelve soundscapes being formed from vocal recordings as well as vocal effects to create unusual sounds.\r
\r
Mystica Features:\r
\r
* unique „Numen Ensemble“ female choir with eight vocalists\r
* 5 GB WAV samples, 24 bit/44.1 kHz\r
* 5 “True Legato” vowels (A, E, I, O, U), separate “Mmmh”-articulation\r
* powerful Phrase-Arranger with 24 words and three different articulations (staccato, fast, slow)\r
* words can be separated in 120 short words/syllables\r
* combine words with True-Legato vowels - automatic vowel selection\r
* 100 Gregorian vocal phrases\r
* 12 soundscapes, moulded from vocal recordings\r
* additional vocal effects\r
* new import/export functions to exchange Phrase-Arranger patches between Mystica and Cantus\r
* dry recordings, perfect to be spiced up with individual reverberation\r
\r
The female choir selected by Tarilonte is the “Numen Ensemble”, founded 2011. This choir is formed by experienced and talented vocalists with broad vocal repertoire. Most singers have been or still are members of renowned ensembles such as the Baroque Sevilla Choir, the Choir of the Maestranza or the Choir of the City of Granada Symphonic Orchestra."""

The Orchestra Complete 3 - New Features - New Instruments - New Presets\r
\r
"The Orchestra Complete 3" combines the powerful orchestration capabilities that have made "The Orchestra" recognized in the composition community with brand-new articulations and the most effective new features ever. Composing faster, more freely, and more uniquely has never been simpler.\r
The third version, which includes all three "The Orchestra" expansions, is filled with thrilling potential and power. Among them are "Horns Of Hell", which features a diabolical "evil brass" section, "Strings Of Winter", which features a 41-piece string orchestra and captures the wild spirit of nature, and "Woods Of The Wild", which re-energizes the woodwinds to catch all that is evocative in their breath.\r
In addition to  these expansions comes the all-in-one package of the base orchestra, a top-quality-recorded 80-piece orchestra with a massive array of articulations and a groundbreaking ensemble engine that has been rebuilt and expanded upon. It's now simpler than ever to turn your ideas into music.\r
\r
What´s Included?\r
\r
"The Orchestra Complete 3" extends our entry-level instrument "The Orchestra" with more instruments, more presets and extended powerful features. Now including:\r
\r
* Woods Of The Wild - Complete and extended woodwind section with impressive articulations like triple tongues and rips and trills. Also included are mallets, other wooden drums, and percussion.\r

* Pure Performance Legato - We are pleased to present a powerful legato engine that has undergone a complete redesign. Because the engine can differentiate between the two articulations without the use of keyswitches, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any hassles.\r
* Main Page: Voicing Selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or choose from over 90 pre-arranged Voicings. The Ensemble Engine is just like having a real-life orchestrator working for you.\r
* Additional presets and multi-instruments - Discover how the Voicings (208 presets), Rhythms (239 presets), and Animated Orchestra settings (223 presets) work with the 5-part arranging engine by exploring the presets to get the most out of "The Orchestra Complete 3". Updated Voicings that use and bring together the expanded libraries in innovative and expressive ways are also included in "The Orchestra Complete 3".\r
* MIDI Export - "The Orchestra Complete 3" comes with MIDI-Export. Patterns and arrangements generated by the engine can be exported onto separate MIDI Tracks, opening endless possibilities.\r
\r

\r
Create Complex Arrangements With Simple Chords\r
\r
Create pulsating rhythms and inspiring full arrangements with simple chords and without the use of any pre-recorded phrases. At the heart of "The Orchestra Complete 3" is the Ensemble Engine, which allows this inspiring dance of instruments and rhythms to unfold before your very eyes with only the press of a chord.\r
\r
* 3 independent arpeggiators and 2 velocity envelopes can be assigned to create vivid and powerful orchestral voicings\r
* Create and customize your own patterns through the sequencer designer.\r
* Load up to 5 different instruments in independent slots and play them together.\r
* Every slot can be assigned to one of five different modules.\r
* Assign percussion to the arpeggiator to create pulsating rhythms.\r
* Voicings selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or you can choose from our 90+ pre-arranged Voicings.\r
\r
Compose Faster with Full Instrumental Groups\r
\r
Choose from nearly 700 Presets in Three Categories.\r
\r
* Orchestral Voicings - Orchestral Voicings include various playable arrangements of instruments that create the fullest and richest orchestral sound.\r
* Orchestral Rhythms - Orchestral Rhythms presets bring you cinematic and expressive rhythms that take full advantage of the Ensemble Engine.\r
* Animated Orchestra - Making full use of all the possibilities of the Ensemble Engine, the Animated Orchestra presets are for the most complex and magical musical ideas.\r
\r
Export Your Custom Performance\r
\r
Drag and drop MIDI to your DAW. Once you have been inspired by a preset or have created your own complex arrangement, drag and drop your passage right from the Kontakt orchestra nki to your DAW. Unleash the power of the Customizer Engine onto your personal template, change notes, combine different patterns, and make them your own.\r
\r
Take Full Control Over The Ensemble\r
\r
Work quickly and intuitively with our straightforward user interface.\r
On the Engine page you can access all individual controls for each of the five instrument modules. Short notes can be arranged with the arpeggiators, while sustained notes can be shaped with the velocity envelope. Create the orchestral colors as you need them and let the magic happen.\r
\r
* Arpeggiator - The arpeggiator creates fascinating melodic patterns to give your project a rich and lively orchestral feeling. Change the pattern of the arpeggiator with the rhythm stepper. If needed, you can modify almost every parameter to stay in full control of your orchestral voicing.\r
* Sequence Designer - The Sequence Designer is included in the arpeggiator. This allows you to create in detail your own musical passages. Instead of following the specific styles of preset arpeggios, create your own and make it as complex as you’d like.\r
* Velocity Envelope - Shape your sustain sounds with the Velocity Envelope, adding to your sound a recurring dynamic movement from a sustained note. The centerpiece is the envelope shape, which can be drawn freely.\r
\r
Play Over 280 Instruments / Articulations Freely\r
\r
Create full and detailed orchestrations from scratch. Play your ideas and your melodies freely with countless single instruments. Included are all standard sections and articulations from a symphonic orchestra, including percussion as well as tonal percussion (Marimbaphone, Vibraphone, Xylophone and Glockenspiel) and as a bonus: choir, piano, cembalo, celesta and a massive church organ.\r
\r
Pure Performance Legato\r
\r
With our Pure Performance Legato technology, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any problems, as the engine can distinguish between both articulations without the need for keyswitches. Special attention was paid to the integration of the true legato transitions, fitting each of the more than 400 transitions per instrument independently into the intervals in a way that allows for a very smooth and playable legato.\r
\r
Ensemble-Multi Patches: Unleash The Full Orchestral Power\r
\r
Multis take the Ensemble Engine even further toward instant playability and epic sound as they load and layer multiple instances of "The Orchestra". The easiest way to create complex orchestral arrangements.\r
There are full playable orchestral multis for single articulations that work perfectly for quick sketching and layering. Orchestral Rhythm and Animated Orchestra Multis combine multiple instances of the Ensemble Engine to create even more complex patterns.\r
\r
The Samples: Rough, Unpolished And Human\r
\r
"The Orchestra" was recorded and processed with the intention to sound a bit rougher and more “honest” than the common Hollywood-sounding orchestra vst. It offers an alternative and promises straight and powerful sounds, punch and a vivid musical experience.\r
The instruments for "The Orchestra" were recorded in Budapest at the renowned Studio 22 in their traditional seating position and mixed and edited with great attention to detail. This way the different sections blend together perfectly in the same room. All essential articulations are available, including playable true legato samples and multiple round robins for short articulations.\r
\r
Preset Browser\r
\r
The updated preset browser is available for "The Orchestra Complete 3", "Strings Of Winter", "Horns Of Hell" and "Woods of the Wild". Explore the massive selection of presets using intuitive filters and categories.\r
\r
Choose Your Favorite Interface Design\r

description = """
Ambient Black is the second of a linked pair of sound design-based virtual instruments designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original instruments and textures suitable for all sorts of ambient music.\r
\r
As its name implies, Ambient Black covers the darker end of the ambient spectrum, focusing on harsh, aggressive, atonal, mysterious, and industrial sounds. Ambient White, the first VI in this series, covers the opposite end of the ambient spectrum.\r
\r
The majority of sounds used in the creation of Ambient Black were derived from organic sources: found sounds and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques, prepared and heavily processed musical instruments, and sounds recorded in natural environments. The synth sounds were also processed with sound design techniques, and combined with various organic sounds and instruments.\r
\r
The end result is a product that combines acoustic, human, industrial, and electronic elements to produce an organic-sounding virtual instrument.\r
\r
THE INSTRUMENT PATCHES\r
\r
Ambient Black features over 280 different instrument patches and combinations (over 6.5 GB of uncompressed WAV data), divided into seven categories:\r
\r
1. Multi-Layered Instruments\r
2. Drones & Atmospheres\r
3. Bass Instruments\r
4. Percussive Instruments\r
5. Melodic Instruments\r
6. Looped Instrument Phrases\r
7. Effects & Textures\r
\r
The most complex instrument patches in Ambient Black are the Multi-Layered Instruments, created using combinations of patches from the other six categories. These patches are organized by their basic type, using the following prefixes:\r
\r
* ATMOS: Layered Atmospheres and Pads\r
* BASS: Layered Bass Instruments\r
* FX: Layered Effects & Textures\r
* LOOP: Layered Looped Phrases\r
* MELO: Layered Melodic Instruments\r
* PERC: Layered Percussive Instruments\r
\r
MULTI-LAYERED INSTRUMENT PATCHES\r
\r
Many of the Multi-Layered Instrument patches consist of multiple evolving atmospheres, effects, textures, and looped phrases. For the best results, try playing these patches with one finger, or in octaves. This suggestion doesn't apply to Layered PERC patches, which in general don't have any pronounced melodic or harmonic content; playing multiple notes at a time with these layered patches can produce some interesting polyrhythmic patterns.\r
\r
EFFECTS & TEXTURES\r
\r
The Effects & Textures category includes a number of strange and aggressive sounds that were primarily designed to be used as cinematic sound design elements. Most don't have an identifiable pitch or key-center, and can be used as drones.\r
\r
PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS\r
\r
The Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic, industrial, and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of cinematic hits, glitches, industrial sounds, and other unusual percussive sounds.\r
\r
DRONES & ATMOSPHERES\r
\r
Many of the Drones & Atmospheres are long and evolve over time. Try holding a key for 10, 20, or even 30 seconds, and listen to how each of these sounds develop. Because most of these sounds are huge and dense, try playing just single notes or octaves.\r
\r
MELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS\r
\r
The Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as pads.\r
\r
LOOPED INSTRUMENTS\r
\r
The Looped Instruments include simple repeating patterns and some complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Some loops do not lock to tempo intentionally in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches. Looped Instruments should be played like the Drones & Atmospheres, using solo notes or octaves for less-complex patterns and different intervals for more experimental and harmonically-dense effects."""

For best results, try playing these patches with one finger, in octaves, or in fifths. This doesn't apply to Layered PERC patches, which in general don't have any pronounced melodic or harmonic content; playing multiple notes at a time with these Layered patches can produce some interesting polyrhythmic patterns.\r
\r
EFFECTS & TEXTURES\r
\r
The Effects & Textures category includes a number of patches that were mainly designed to work in tandem with other types of patches. These patches were designed with that in mind.\r
\r
PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS\r
\r
The Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of tuned hand drums, cymbals and gongs, and other percussive sounds.\r
\r
PADS & ATMOSPHERES\r
\r
Many of the Pads & Atmospheres also include chordal components. When trying these patches for the first time, it's probably best to play them with one finger or in octaves. You can then experiment with playing different intervals, depending on the level of harmonic complexity you're looking for.\r
\r
MELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS\r
\r
The Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also few have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as Pads.\r
\r
LOOPED INSTRUMENT PHRASES\r
\r
The Looped Instrument Phrases include simple repeating patterns and some more-complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Many of the loops lock to tempo, but some do not; this was done intentionally, in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches.

From the powerful duo of Jeff Carruthers and Michael Carey comes Movement: Pop Rock Hits, a Pop-Rock Library packed with radio ready tracks and chart-topping hits. Based on the sounds of both current radio hits and styles that are on the rise, Movement is truly ahead of the curve and delivers all the elements necessary to create solid pop-rock tracks for the modern ear. With over 3.5 GB of original content split between 10 full construction kits, you know that only the best production methods were followed, only the best gear was used and not a single corner was cut. Each Construction Kit includes full sections to build entire rock tracks from front to back and a folder of multi-drum stems so that you have complete production control over your drum track.\r

Michael Carey, an established and highly sought after LA guitarist, producer and programmer, takes care of the stringed instruments here with the vibe and precision that comes only with a lifetime of recording and performing at the highest level. Michael also co-produced this library, and his unique sound gives Movement something truly special. All Drums and Percussion are straight from the legendary M.B. Gordy, and sound every bit as amazing as you would expect from the man who's reputation is only topped by hearing the man himself. In Movement: Pop Rock Hits, we give you access to 10 full drum sessions with multi stems and stereo mixes from M.B. Gordy himself. All vocals were performed by Julia Feldman, and drip with character, and true emotion that you wont find anywhere else. The entire project was co-produced and overseen by the amazing Jeff Carruthers, who is hands-down, the very best in the business. The name Jeff Carruthers is synonymous with “Quality” and everything this amazing musician and producer touches is pure gold. Not only did Jeff produce, he also recorded some instruments for the library and the result is simply stunning. Movement: Pop Rock Hits is a library that was exciting to put together, and we know it will be exciting to use, take a listen to the demos and see for yourself!\r

NOTE FROM THE PRODUCERS\r
\r
Our intention with these kits was to create an inspiring, instantly useful collection of loops, stems, parts, and textures for modern pop/indie/rock producers, composers and DJs. We drew from a rich mixture of organic and electronic sounds and styles; indie-acoustic, electro- pop, 80's synths and drum machines, gorgeously recorded real drum kits and percussion, aggressive, saturated bass, and lush, vintage electric and acoustic guitars (recorded through boutique pedals, classic amps, mic's and mic pre's) for fat, satisfying, timeless sounds. Happy music-making!\r

Vintage Rhythm Section is a virtual instrument for Kontakt 5 designed to emulate the classic rhythm section sounds of R&B, Soul, Funk, Jazz, and Rock records from the 1960's and 1970's.\r
\r
Vintage Rhythm Section (VRS) is easy to use, with a simple interface that lets you work quickly and intuitively. If you're producing retro or indie-style music on a budget, or if you're a TV or film composer working on a tight deadline, VRS can be used to create live-sounding drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, and percussion tracks.\r
\r
CAPTURING THAT VINTAGE RHYTHM SECTION SOUND\r
\r
Like its sister-products, Vintage Horns and Vintage Strings, Vintage Rhythm Section was not designed to be a shiny, perfect-sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way rhythm sections sounded back in the 60's and 70's, including some of the minor imperfections that added character to those instruments and made them sound so good.\r
\r
For VRS, we sampled a large collection of vintage instruments - some amazingly still in mint condition, and others looking every bit as "vintage" as you'd expect a piece of 40-50 year-old gear to look.\r
\r
Wherever possible, we used the same types of amps and mics that were used in the 60's and 70's. Some of this old gear was pretty funky-sounding, which probably would have disqualified it from being used on most other types of sample libraries. But for VRS, it was just what we were looking for.\r
\r
VRS features two easy-to-use GUIs:\r
\r
1) A 12-channel mixer for drums\r
2) The main GUI, which is used for all of the keyboards, basses, and guitars.\r
\r
THE DRUM MIXER\r
\r
- Reverb Select: This is a drop-down menu that allows you to select various types of convolution IRs.\r
- Channel Strips: Each offers controls for Treble, Bass, Reverb Amount, Pan, and Solo/Mute. Note that not all kits have the same number of toms and cymbals. Instead, each kit was custom-built to fit the musical genre and era it came from.\r
- Master Channel: Allows you to add tape saturation (SAT) and/or compression (COMP) to the entire kit.\r
\r
THE MAIN GUI\r
\r
From top to bottom and left to right, this GUI has the following controls:\r
\r
- TAPE SAT adds tape-style saturation/compression\r
- TREBLE adds or cuts high end\r
- BASS adds or cuts low end\r
- DISTORTION SWITCH - use this to turn the effect on or off\r
- DISTORTION adds amp-style distortion\r
- DELAY controls the amount of tape-style delay\r
- DELAY SELECT allows you to choose from several types of delay\r
- ROTATOR SWITCH turs Leslie-style effect on or off\r
- ROTATOR allows you to select the speed of the Leslie-effect\r
- REVERB controls the amount of reverb added\r
- REVERB SELECT allows you to choose from a selection of high-quality Convolution Reverbs designed to replicate a number of vintage amp-reverbs and recording spaces\r
- MOD-WAH SWITCH turns on your controller's Mod Wheel as a wah-wah pedal\r
\r
Key-Switches\r
\r
Key-switching is a function that allows the user to quickly change from one articulation to another. If an instrument has any key-switch options, it will have red keys located on the far left of the Kontakt virtual keyboard. Many of the basses and guitars offer key-switched long and short (sustain and staccato) articulations, and some of the keyboards offer different key-switched presets."""

Vintage Strings is a virtual instrument for Kontakt 5 designed to emulate the classic violin string section sounds of R&B, Soul, and Funk records from the 1960's and 1970's. Whether you're an experienced arranger or casual producer, Vintage Strings was designed to make it quick and easy for you to create great sounding string tracks for your productions. Like its sister product, Vintage Horns, Vintage Strings was not designed to be a shiny, perfect sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way string sections sounded back in the '60s and '70s; including the decidedly not classical playing style and minor imperfections that added character to those sections and made them sound so good.\r
\r
For Vintage Strings we recorded a 6 piece violin section using vintage Neuman U-87 mics and Royer ribbon mics run through a great sounding SSL board. To capture a true vintage string sound, we used close mics, room mics, and string section positioning based on actual session notes from old Motown and Philly Soul recording sessions. Rather than record the violins in a magnificent concert hall or some other large and resonant recording space, we recorded our players in a funky old studio with a smaller, less-reverberant room that had characteristics similar to the rooms used to record classic Soul and R&B records. Using the tracks we recorded in this space, we then created three types of sections:\r
\r
2 VIOLINS:\r
\r
The 2VLN patches are very useful for creating the sound of smaller string sections. Even if played in 3-part harmony, these patches sound like a 6 piece section, rather than a full orchestral string section. The 2VLN patches take up a lot less sonic space in the mix, and also have the advantage of sounding like the smaller types of string sections used on a lot of old Soul and R&B records, which didn't have the time or budget to record a larger section.\r
\r
6 VIOLINS:\r
\r
The 6VLN patches are great for recording unison (1 part) lines that emulate the sound of a true 6 violin section, which was very commonly used in many old Soul recordings. When used for 2-part harmonies or octaves these patches can be used to replicate the sound of an overdubbed 6 violin section (i.e., a faux 12 violin section), which was a very common recording technique used on many Motown recording sessions.\r
\r
12 VIOLINS:\r
\r
The 12VLN patches are very useful for creating unison (1 part) string lines that sound like an overdubbed 6 violin section. If you want to get a bigger sound with the size of a larger orchestral string section, without the color and character present in a large recroding hall or symphonic space, use the patches for string parts in 2 or 3 part harmonies.\r
\r
The result is a virtual instrument that has a sound and character that is distinctly different from orchestral based sampled string libraries. The sound of Vintage Strings is intentionally not big, rich, and glossy. It's a smaller, more intimate, and more "human" sound, which more accurately emulates the string sound on those classic old records.\r
\r
FAST AND EASY STRING SECTION PARTS USING PRE-SET PATCHES\r
\r
If you don't have a lot experience writing for strings, or even if you're an experienced string-arranger on a tight deadline, Vintage Strings also offers a number of pre-programmed instrument patches that can help you quickly create great sounding string parts. These include the Tonal Harmonization Patches, which contain 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part patches for 2, 6, and 12 violins. Playing with just one finger on your keyboard you can easily write string lines in 2 parts (intervals), 3 parts (triads), or 4 parts (seventh chords). Secondly, the Tonal Harmonization patches include Fixed Chord & Interval Patches containing 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part Chord Patches, for 2, 6, and 12 violins. These patches are programmed to play a specific interval or chord according to the type of patch in 12 different keys.\r
\r
THE VINTAGE STRINGS GUI\r
\r
The Vintage Strings graphical user interface (GUI) is very simple and easy to use. The main page of the interface includes control over tape saturation, high EQ, and reverb with 15 custom selected convolution reverbs.\r
\r
THE HARMONIZE PAGE\r
\r
On the Harmonize page you can choose the key and scale of the interval or chord-based preset patches, or create custom interval and chord-based patches of your own.\r

Zodiac is a unique-sounding Virtual Instrument designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original sounds and instruments suitable for film or TV scores, video games, and all types of ambient and experimental music.\r
\r
No synthesizers were used to create the instruments in Zodiac. Instead, all instruments were created from organic sources such as found sounds, sonic manipulations inspired by classic Musique Concrete, Experimental and Avant Garde Music compositions, prepared or heavily processed musical instruments, and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques.\r
\r
Zodiac features over 200 patches and Multis (over 8GB of uncompressed wav data), divided into six categories:\r
\r
* Pads & Atmospheres\r
* Melodic Instruments\r
* Bass Instruments\r
* Percussive Instruments\r
* Experimental Instruments\r
* Zodiac Kits\r
\r
Zodiac's instruments range from beautiful and ethereal soundscapes to wildly inventive percussion and mysterious, haunting, atonal and experimental sounds that defy easy categorization. Search through Zodiac's patch folders, and you won't find anything like a regular bass, guitar, keyboard, or drum set. Instead, you'll find a collection of sounds that are quite unlike those made by any standard instrument.\r
\r
Not only does Zodiac feature a constellation of ready-to-use instrument patches, it's also a powerful sound-design VI. Use Zodiac's simple but versatile controls to dramatically alter, sculpt, or tweak and customize sounds to fit your individual style. However, you don't even need to touch a single control to get a variety of sounds from Zodiac's preset patches.\r
\r
Zodiac is made for experimentation: hold down a key on many instrument patches and a sound loops and morphs, revealing surprising musical timbres and harmonic strata. Play an instrument one way and it has a percussive quality; play it another, and the notes expand into a pad or atmosphere. Play a patch in one octave and it sounds dreamy and surreal; play it in another octave and it behaves and sounds quite differently.\r
\r
No matter what soft synths, sound modules, or VIs you already own, Zodiac will expand the palette of sounds in your sonic tool box and add a unique character to your music.\r
\r
The Zodiac GUI\r
\r
Despite its somewhat enigmatic appearance, Zodiac's Graphic User Interface (GUI) is quite simple to use. Here's the key:\r
\r
The Control Banks\r
\r
ON either side of the Zodiac logo is a control bank consisting of SIX levers. Under each lever is a single letter, which stand for the following:\r
\r
(Lefthand Bank)\r
\r
AMP ENV - Amp Envelope controls:\r
\r
A - Attack\r
D - Decay\r
S - Sustain\r
R - Release\r
\r
T - Tuning (Pitch)\r
R - Reverb amount\r
\r
(Righthand Bank)\r
\r
DELAY - the Delay controls:\r
\r
T - Delay Time\r
D - Delay Damping\r
P - Dealy Panning\r
F - Delay Feedback\r
\r
B - Bass\r
T - Treble\r
\r
The Levers\r
\r
Note that the four white-tipped levers on either side represent a grouping of related controls, and have a range of 0 to 10.\r
\r
Note also that the red-tipped levers represent controls not related to the white groups, and that three of these have a range from -10 to +10.\r
\r
Use command-click (MAC) or control-click (PC) to return any of the levers to the default setting of zero.\r
\r
The Reverb Window\r
\r
The window below the Zodiac logo contains a drop-down menu, with a list of fifteen very different-sounding Convolution Reverb IRs. Click on this window if you'd like to change the type of reverb on the instrument being played. Note that the R(everb) lever to the left of the window controls the amount of reverb.\r
\r
Zodiac is powered by the industry-leading Kontakt engine. It is compatible with VST, AudioUnit, AAX (Pro Tools 10) and RTAS (Pro Tools 9 & 10) plug-in formats allowing it to work seamlessly within any major sequencer, in addition to standalone use.\r

Handbell V2 Sampled Articulations -\r
\r
Handbell Clapper - samples are created with the traditional technique of holding it against the shoulder, bell-upwards, and then swinging the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting of the bell.\r
\r
Suspended Handbell with a soft rubber mallet - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a soft rubber mallet.\r
\r
Suspended Handbell with a hard rubber mallet - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a hard rubber mallet.\r
\r
Suspended Handbell with a plastic chopstick - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a plastic chopstick. This creates a great deal of high frequency content for a special effect.\r
\r
Singing Handbells - The Singing Handbells sound is created by running a wood dowel along the rim of the handbell, similar to the way you can run a wet finger along the edge of a crystal glass and make it sing.\r
\r
Plucked Handbells - is accomplished by using the thumb and forefinger to force the clapper head into the casting while the bell is on the table, producing a staccato note.\r
\r
Malleted Handbells on a padded table - samples are created by striking the bell with a rubber mallet while the bell is resting on the foam of a padded table. This produces a tone brighter and more percussive than the plucked samples.\r
\r
Handbell Shakes - is accomplished by quickly ringing the bell back and forth so that the clapper strikes both the front and back of the bell casting in rapid succession. This creates a continuous sustained tone.\r
\r
Martellato (mart) - this articulation is created when the handbell is rung by holding it by the handle and gently striking the full body of the handbell horizontally on the padded table.\r
\r
Martellato Lift (mart-lift) - is the above Martellato articulation followed by immediately lifting the handbell from the table to allow the bell to continue to ring."""

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO PIANO\r
\r
The vibrancy and realism of CSP make it the perfect piano accompaniment to the rest of the Cinematic Studio Series of orchestral libraries. CSP features a beautiful Yamaha C7 Grand, recorded in Australia’s premiere scoring stage. Great care went into capturing the full dynamic range of the instrument, with the pedal up and down. We also captured the incidental key and pedal noises that occur during a real performance, adding greater authenticity to the sound.\r
\r
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND REALISTIC\r
\r
Like the rest of the Cinematic Studio Series, CSP features a no-nonsense GUI, which is easy to learn so you can get straight to work. Four microphone channels, controlled via the mixer, provide the perfect combination of detail and ambience. We also included a variety of scrapes, glissandos and plucks in an FX patch, perfect for adding tension to a score. The output routing feature makes it easy to sculpt your own sound, and the modest resource footprint means you can comfortably add it to any project.\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Piano is recorded in the same world-class scoring stage as Cinematic Studio Strings, and is the perfect piano accompaniment to the rest of the series. With an integrated high quality reverb, multiple microphone positions and carefully recorded key and pedal noises, CSP’s intuitive GUI and real-life sound make it an invaluable addition to your orchestral template."""

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS\r
\r
CSS features a Hollywood-style string section, recorded in position in Australia’s premiere scoring stage – Trackdown. From the soaring colourful vibrato of the high violins to the dark and woody textures of the low cello and bass notes, you’ll be instantly inspired. Our aim was to create an instrument that’s instantly playable, sounds great out-of-the-box and is backed up by speedy customer support.\r
\r
GROUNDBREAKING INTERFACE\r
\r
At the heart of CSS is its cutting edge GUI, building on our previous critically-acclaimed library Cinematic Strings 2. This means a short-but-sweet patch list, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. These features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page, you’ll have CSS working alongside you on your latest project within minutes.\r
\r
REALISTIC AND EXPRESSIVE\r
\r
CSS features a stunningly realistic legato engine. We painstakingly recorded true legato transitions for each note, up and down, including a beautiful portamento. We also recorded ‘re-bow’ samples, meaning you can play repeated legato notes smoothly and with true-legato realism. Please check out the Legato Introduction video below. NEW: Powerful marcato articulation allows you to  create highly realistic runs with ease.\r
\r
LIVE SOUND, NO REVERB REQUIRED\r
\r
With smooth legato, punchy spiccatos, inspiring textural harmonics and con sordino, CSS covers a wide range of the sound palette afforded by a world-class string section. We’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound, so you’ll feel like you’re at a live session. With this new level of realism, you’ll feel comfortable using CSS without reverb; in fact, we recommend it! All of our demos were created without reverb – all you hear is the natural air captured in the samples.\r
\r
FULLY MIXED - LOAD AND PLAY\r
\r
We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record CSS at three distances, which you can combine to create your own unique mix either inside Kontakt or via the newly included output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our pre-mixed combination of all 3 if you want a great sound with fewer resources.

NEW! CINEMATIC STUDIO WOODWINDS\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is the latest addition to the Cinematic Studio Series collection. Whether you want to blow the roof off with the bright penetrating sound of the piccolo, express emotion with the beautiful lyrical oboe, or vibrate the floor with the deep and powerful bass clarinet, these superb instruments bring warmth and vitality to your orchestral template. They perfectly complement the rest of the series: the Strings, Solo Strings, Brass and Piano.\r
\r
INTUITIVE, EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE\r
\r
At the heart of Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is its intuitive and efficient GUI. This means one patch per instrument, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. To save memory, articulations can be loaded in or out of RAM with a couple of clicks. As the layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings and Brass, these features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page.\r
\r
BROAD PALETTE — SOLOISTS AND SECTIONS\r
\r
To record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds we used a marvellous selection of top-tier players to capture the full range and character of each of nine solo instruments and four sections. Whether you want the fine detail of a soloist, or the warm collaborative synergy of our two-player sections, we recorded the full dynamic range to harness both nuance and power. Every instrument was treated equally, including the piccolo, cor anglais, alto flute, bass clarinet and contrabassoon.\r
\r
VERSATILITY AND REALISM\r
\r
CSW features a range of articulations including playful short notes, expansive textures with flutter-tongue and trills, and a stunningly realistic legato engine. We spent countless hours recording true long-form legato transitions for each note, resulting in unparalleled realism. Because we’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound you’ll feel like you’re in the room with the players. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure a delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism.\r
\r
FULLY MIXED — LOAD AND PLAY\r
\r
We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds at four mic distances: Close, Overhead, Main and Room, which you can combine to create your own mix inside Kontakt or via the output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our ready-to-go mix position that contains all four mics in a stereo mix if you want a great sound with fewer resources.

\r
DETAILED SOLOISTS, POWERFUL SECTIONS\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Brass is a highly versatile library, capable of bringing you the sweet sounds of a gentle melody, or packing a real punch to bring all the drama and impact of a real Hollywood brass section to your music. We recorded the full dynamic range across every instrument, so when you play hard, you’ll hear hard – thanks to our talented players giving their all in every session. There’s nothing like hearing a brass ensemble really bring a room to life, and that’s exactly the sensation we’ve captured here.\r
\r
UNRIVALED REALISM AND CONSISTENCY\r
\r
We’ve broken new ground here with our smooth and powerful legato and marcato articulations. Long-form legato was captured across the entire dynamic range – the result of countless hours of recordings and retakes. You’ll be swept away by the level of realism we’ve achieved. In addition the legato scripting has been upgraded with further under-the-hood functionality, so sculpting new melodic phrases is easier than ever. As always, we’ve maintained the highest possible level of consistency across all instruments to give them all a similar feel on the keyboard.\r

PRESENTING CINEMATIC STUDIO SOLO STRINGS\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings is the perfect complement to Cinematic Studio Strings. CSSS brings you solo violins 1 and 2, viola and cello to add a tantalising new dimension to your musical creations. We spent more than 120 hours recording Australia’s finest string players in a world-class scoring stage, using a unique combination of microphones to capture the individual character and charm of each instrument. The result is a stunning package of playable, realistic solo strings that stands out from the crowd either on their own, as an exquisite quartet, or as first chair for the full-section strings.\r
\r
INTUITIVE, EASY TO USE GUI\r
\r
The GUI is streamlined and efficient, with a minimal number of patches making it quick and easy to learn. The layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings, so you can double the solo instrument patches with their section counterparts (eg Solo Violin I with 1st Violins), and play them at the same time on one MIDI channel. This first-chair functionality serves to reinforce the sound of each section, with the lush sound of the section bolstered by a 1st-chair solo patch. This blending together of the two libraries creates an even smoother, richer sound.\r
\r
VIRTUOSO SOLO, QUARTET OR FIRST CHAIR\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings brings all the emotional depth and virtuosity of an outstanding quartet to your fingertips, making it the perfect compositional tool for exposed lyrical solo or quartet passages. And because we maintained positional accuracy and recorded the same diverse range of articulations, CSSS provides a vibrant first-chair accompaniment to our full section library Cinematic Studio Strings. This allows you to seamlessly transition between writing for solo strings and full sections.\r
\r
UNPARALLELED REALISM\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings are expressive, emotive and powerful, with a smooth realistic sound that gives any melody that elusive human touch. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure that delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism. All of the dynamics have been preserved in their natural state, and as with CSS, no EQ or reverb was applied to the demos, so what you hear is the pure, out-of-the-box sound.\r
\r
COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ARTICULATIONS\r
\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings features a comprehensive list of playing articulations and styles, including true long-form legato for enhanced realism, portamentos and marcato. There is an excellent range of short notes, as well as tremolos, trills, and col legno. The articulation list, dynamic layers and keyswitch layout of the library match Cinematic Studio Strings in order to provide  a perfect first-chair accompaniment.\r

description = "Equinoxe is a virtual analogue synthesizer for Windows only from the English developer SuperWave based on the Ultimate synthesizer and made for recreating the works of Jean Michel Jarre. It has two oscillators, an arpeggiator, effects (delay, limiter with drive, phaser, chorus tone control and reverb) and an envelope generator with DADSR (decay-attack-decay-sustain-release). Its first oscillator can also function as the Ultimate Oscillator which has a total of 16 fully programmable oscillators which can be stereo spread, detuned and synced separately. Oscillator 1 waveforms include Ultimate Osc, Tri Sync Osc, Noise, Triangle, Sf2 Exp and Saw. Oscillator 2 waveforms are Saw, Square, Noise, Perc and Triangle. The arpeggiator of Equinoxe handles both classic and phrase arpeggiation with modes such as Down/Back, Up/Forward, Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 (note: Alt meaning 'alternative'). The sequencer of Equinoxe is a 4 X 32 step sequencer (meaning that it has got 4 32-step sequencers). In each sequence, parameters such as position and modulation parameters can be edited. The sequencer supports the playing modes Forward and Reverse. The synthesizer also has two low frequency oscillators (LFOs). Equinoxe has two filters: a state-variable filter of -12 dB/-24 dB and a Moog filter (for the creation warm, vintage sounds). The Equinoxe comes bundled with Cubase projects and MIDI files to demonstrate the features of it. The songs \"Magnetic Fields 2\" and \"Equinoxe 4\" are supplied with the demo version and 12 additional tracks are supplied with the plugin when it is purchased from the author. Additionally, the SuperWave Drums Bundle, containing the SuperWave drum modules D-808, D-909 and Tiny Pops, is also provided free of charge. The plugin comes with 192 presets including basses, leads, strings, pads and sound effects. The presets of Equinoxe include \"Oxygene 4 Lead 1\", \"Oxygene 4 Lead 2\", \"MFields 2 Lead 1\", \"FX Bird Tweets\" and \"FX Wind Fade 4\". A feature worth mentioning is that Equinoxe also comes with an initialize bank, containing preset probrams (both fxb and fxp formats) for all the waveforms, including the Ultimate Oscillator waveforms such as Ramp and Soft Ramp. This way, it is easier (also for a blind user) to change the waveform of Equinoxe from one to another. After registering the plugin, it might happen that it won't play when trying to play with the synthesizer. This occurs due to the safety features introducet with Windows. To fix this problem, the digital audio workstation (DAW) needs to be run as an administrator (or with administrator privileges). Please look for question \"Q15\" (full title: \"Q15. After installing any of the SuperWave commercial plugins, I can’t hear any sound. Is there a problem with my VST Host when running SuperWave plugins?\", currently a third level heading) for more information about the issue from the Support section of SuperWave (https://www.superwavesynths.com/support)."
accessibility_description = """
The plugin parameters can be edited with the Automation Window of the digital audio workstation (tested on REAPER 6.73 with OSARA and Psycle Modular Music Creation Studio version 1.12.0 by using its native "Parameter List" function, found under the Plugin Window (Shift+Enter) and its "View" menu). (Note: on OSARA, please press P to access the Parameter Window of a track where Equinoxe VST instrument is used in order to access the parameters of Equinoxe). The Sequencer On/Of switch and the MIDI Learn function are not accessible for a screen reader user and require sighted assistance to be executed. For example, a work-around on using the sequencer button is to make two presets (for an instance, with the REAPER or Psycle program) and to have the sighted person press the Sequencer On /Off switch and make presets so that the sequencer is turned on (preset name example: "equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_on") and where it is turned off (preset name example: "equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_off"). Then, a blind person can independently load the .fxp filesusing the load function of the VST host or digital audio workstation (DAW) (such as the "Preset menu" or "+" button in REAPER's FX Window) to load the preset to the track where Equinoxe is located in. Because of these facts stated above, the accessibility ratio (a rough estimate of the accessibility of the plugin) is about 55-65 percent. \r
\r
It is worth mentioning that a blind user should ask a registry file (with the .reg extension) to be provided by the developer via an email. The .reg file allows a blind user to register the products (including Equinoxe) independently because the registry information (i.e. license key and user ID) are stored on that file. To execute it, please press the Enter key few times. First, the Windows system should ask you if you wanted the registry changes included in the file to be stored on the registry (please answer "Yes" on this question). Finally, the Windows system should announce that the registration was successfully made so please quit the dialog with the press of the "OK" button."""

The Best M7 Simulation Ever\r
Made Possible With Fusion-IR\r
\r
For years the Bricasti M7 eluded all attempts to capture and reproduce the subtle beauty of this legendary hardware. Many in the industry considered it impossible.\r
Fusion-IR is a unique modulated convolution-based capture and reproduction technology developed specifically around the needs of M7. It redefines the rules of acoustic and workflow possibilities for convolution based reverberation processors.\r
\r
Nothing comes closer to M7 hardware than Seventh Heaven Professional.\r
\r
Now used around the world, from the smallest mountain-top backpack studios to the biggest post production facilities in London and Los Angeles, Seventh Heaven Professional is the definitive way to experience the power and beauty of M7 reverbs natively within your DAW in up to Atmos 7.1.6.\r
\r
The M7 excels in presenting the world’s most realistic simulation of rooms, spaces and plates in the most flattering of lights.\r
From tight, realistic interiors, chambers and studios to lush outdoor expanses, cathedrals and halls, the M7 can do it all.\r
Seventh Heaven Professional includes every single preset available in the Bricasti M7.\r
This includes all v1 and v2 firmware revision presets, including the special nonlinear reverbs and even additional interiors presets not available in hardware.\r
It took many months of fully automated capture to produce the thousands of Fusion-IRs needed for Seventh Heaven Professional. Only then could the true finesse of the modulated hardware be achieved via convolution. The early reflections, low frequency reverb, and late reverb were captured individually for the ultimate in control and acoustic realism.\r
\r
The Sound And Flexibility of Algorithmic Reverbs\r
\r
Treat Seventh Heaven Professional like any algorithmic reverb and forget what you’ve heard about the lifeless sound of convolution. It doesn’t apply here.\r
In a sampled reverb it is typically impossible to sculpt a space as required, and as is expected from users of hardware and software algorithmic reverbs. Even simple, critical tasks such as balancing the early and late reverb are impossible jobs with most convolution reverbs. Not to mention, usually any modulation is completely lost and the captures lose the organic life of the hardware.\r
Not so in Seventh Heaven Professional. It has the flexibility of algorithmic reverbs allowing you to perfect the acoustics of a space just as can be done on an M7 and retains the organic, lively vibe thought to be impossible to capture.\r
You can even use the stereo captures in surround workflows. LiquidSonics’ advanced impulse response decorrelation technology ensures excellent fold-down compatibility and the convenience of up to 7.1.6 workflows in your DAW.\r
Vast Editing Potential\r
\r
The Ultimate Reverb Tails\r
\r
The M7’s lush, rich decays are the star of the show. The original v1 decays are the most realistic ever heard, and the v2 exhibit stunning modulation qualities.\r
Every preset’s decay can be set across the M7’s full decay time range (from 200 milliseconds right up to 30 seconds).\r
\r
Delays With Added Tempo Synchronisation\r
\r
The M7’s pre-delay and multi-voice delay can be modified as freely as within the hardware itself.\r
Seventh Heaven Professional takes a further step by providing the ability to sync pre-delay and delay to DAW tempo.\r
\r
Reflection Pattern Selection\r
\r
Each and every modulated early reflection pattern has been captured and can be freely swapped at will. Any space can be absolutely transformed, an unprecedented feat for a sampled reverb.\r
Advanced Equalisation\r
\r
Precise Roll-off Filtering\r
\r
The M7’s unique roll-off curves are perfectly designed for its reverberation and reflections. Each curve (different for v1/v2 decay and early reflections) was studied and reproduced in every available position. This provides an extremely accurate reproduction of this critical component in the acoustic chain.\r
\r
5-band Post-EQ\r
\r
The M7’s early and late reverb filters have been augmented with a full 5-band parametric equaliser in Seventh Heaven Professional.\r
\r
Frequency Dependent Reverb Decay Times\r
\r
Seventh Heaven Professional also includes the ability to apply post-process low and high frequency decay time modification to the reverb.\r
\r
Ducking\r
\r
Ducking is a very powerful tool that helps you improve clarity of a reverb by tucking the wet away until a musical phrase has ended, the reverb simply floods in to fill the space rather than competing with the instrument itself."""

The unmistakable plate reverb sound – warm, rich and spacious – is now at your fingertips.\r
\r
Inspired by the original EMT 140 plate reverb, we captured the gorgeous sound and vibe of this studio classic and turned it into a fun and musically inspiring plug-in. And we couldn’t resist pushing the limits of reality, so we added a couple of fun twists that let you take Little Plate to spaces the original hardware only dreamed of.\r
\r
Simple Control, Infinite Possibilities\r
\r
Once we recreated the iconic 140 sound, we couldn’t resist going even further.\r
While the original reverb could only muster a modest five seconds of reverberation time, we pushed that number higher. A lot higher. With Decay Time set to infinity, Little Plate’s reverb tails never fade away. Check out these audio clips of presets that demonstrate this:\r
\r
Keep your reverb and your mixes clean with the built-in Low Cut filter.\r
\r
Sometimes the low frequency build-up in reverbs can get a little out of control. Use the Low Cut control to tame those boomy bass frequencies.\r
\r
Flip the Mod switch to introduce slight modulation into the reverb tail.\r
\r
These subtle and chaotic variations can result in a thicker and smoother sound, especially at long decay times on pitched instruments like keys, guitar, and voice.\r
\r
Heavy Vibes\r
\r
At Soundtoys, we’ve got a reputation for obsessing over legendary hardware. But when we decided to build our first reverb plug-in, we went farther than ever before. We collected five EMT 140s from around the country and gathered them in our lab.\r
We tuned them up. We teched them out. We went to the chiropractor (that’s one and a half tons of plate reverb). Then we took our time listening and testing, zeroing in on a sound that we think captures the classic EMT 140 vibe. Warm, rich, spacious and slightly dark, Little Plate packs the essence of plate reverb into one little plug-in that won’t break your back.\r
\r
A Little Plate History\r
\r
The EMT 140 uses a magnetic transducer to vibrate a massive sheet of metal, sending the result back to the engineer via a pickup that captures the resulting reverberation.\r
The EMT 140 was introduced in 1957 and was capable of dense and smooth reverberation unlike anything the world had heard. While it doesn’t exactly sound like a real room, it has a beauty of its own, which is why plate reverb is still such a sought-after sound even many decades later. 140s are getting hard to find though, and replacement parts even harder. Not to mention their sheer size and weight keep them out of reach of the average studio."""

CineSamples takes you back
to 90s movies with its new bank of trumpets for Kontakt 90s Retro Trumpets.
The story that led to 90's
Retro Trumpets is quite original. The CineSamples team were making takes at the
MGM Scoring Stage at Sony Picture Studios in Los Angeles last year when they
came across directions for the orchestra's recording sessions for Jurassic Park
(the first). The idea therefore came to reproduce this sound by following these
instructions and with the help of the people from Sony Scoring who were present
at the time.
Direction the studios with
a set of four veteran trumpeters with the instruments and playing techniques of
the time, To perform the takes, CineSamples used the same three Neumann M50
microphones modified in Decca Tree configuration, patched the preamp parameters
to the same models always present in the studio, applied Lexicon 480 reverb and
Avalon 2055 EQ also available. The result of all this is a sound that is less
metallic, simpler and softer than modern recorded trumpets.
90's Retro Trumpets thus
includes 12 patches, the interface for Kontakt also allows you to access the
six keyswitches, the dynamics (to be managed with the modulation wheel), the
vibrato, the velocity, the legato, the mute of the trumpets and three effects:
tape saturation, EQ and reverb. You can also extend the note range of the
trumpets beyond what was recorded if you need to."""

to similarly develop a fresh sound in many new and different ways. Among these
may be mentioned
 The Phrase Builder: A

More Tina Guo at
CineSamples
CineSamples completes the
collection of cello samples played by Tina Guo with a second volume offering
new articulations.
Tina Guo Volume 2
completes the Tina Guo Acoustic Cello Legato bank by providing additional
articulations, including spiccato, marcato, sul ponticello, vibrato pizzicato
and harmonics. This new edition should also facilitate your melodic passages by
offering more agility, faster playing with less vibrato.
To produce this new
volume, Tina Guo used the same cello and the teams worked at the MGM Scoring
Stage in Los Angeles using the same microphones and the same mixing as for the
original collection.
The graphic interface in
Kontakt and the Kontakt Player allows you to adjust the legato speed, the
volume of the release, the reverb, to vary the movements of the bow and even to
bring a little surprise in the reading thanks to a function of randomization.
The modulation wheel will finally be used to control the overall dynamics and
know that the instrument is NKS compatible.
Tina Guo vol. 2 is a
valuable expansion of the original Tina Guo Acoustic Cello Legato library that
uses the same unique seamless recording and programming techniques. The legato
of flight. 2 allows for more nimble melodic passages and additional articulations
such as spiccato, marcato, harmonics, sul ponticello, and pizzicato vibrato.
Combining volume 2 with the original library results in a complete combination
of Tina's solo acoustic cello.
A completely new product
How is Tina Guo vol 2
different from Tina Guo Acoustic Cello Legato?
The main difference is the
playing style. Tina Guo Acoustic Cello Legato is characterized by a romantic
and expressive playing style that lends itself well to longer melodic lines.
Tina Guo vol 2 allows for an agile and more connected style of play. Also,
faster playing naturally allows less time for vibrato on passing notes. Volume
2 also features other articulations that are not available in the original
library (see below).
Otherwise, Tina played the
same instrument at the MGM Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, recorded with the same
microphones as the original library. Tim Starnes recreated the same mix as the
original library as well as the desktop mix from the Scoring Stage.
Articulations
 Attack overlay
Selecting this option adds
a staccato attack overlay to the beginnings of the sustains. Its volume depends
on the speed. They appear at higher speeds. Support attack is also speed
sensitive.
 Legato
Selecting this option
enables monophonic harmonization with recorded legato transitions. Unselected
allows polyphonic sustain samples only. Legato transitions are velocity
sensitive.
 ∞ Bow
Unselected, this includes
Tina's natural bow changes on sustained notes. Selected, it allows you to
lengthen the arc length as needed. Just re-attack a note when you need a change
of bow on the same note.
 Volume of releases
This controls the volume
of released notes. If set too high, it will sound like it has too much reverb
and decay. Too low a setting will make legato transitions sound unnatural.
 Legato Speed ​​(CC02)
Higher settings allow for
faster reading. Lower settings allow for slower playback and will reveal more
of the recorded legato transition.
 Mod Wheel
The modulation wheel
controls the overall dynamics.
Other articulations
include:
 Open Strings - attaches
to the 4 open strings of the cello
 Sul Ponticello
 Harmonics
 Spiccato
 Marcato - an elongated
espressivo-style short
 Pizzicato Vibrato"""

CINESAMPLES ADAPTIVE LEGATO ENGINE
CineBrass PRO v1.5 has been rebuilt from the ground up
to include the Legacy CineSamples adaptive engine featured in CineStrings SOLO,
CineStrings CORE, and CineWinds CORE and PRO.
It allows you to tailor the legato response to your
own playing style, and is designed to respond musically to your performance.
The engine detects your game speed and intelligently
adjusts the interval speed to match it.
This means you can play slow, expressive lines and
fast passages in a single performance, without touching the speed dial.
Additionally, the Intensity parameter responds to velocity.
PATCH CHANGE
The Horns Ensemble Stopped and Fluttered has been
split into two different patches: Horn Ensemble Stopped and Horn Ensemble Fluttered

collection of brass soloists ever sampled. Today's premier chairs in Hollywood
are recorded in Sony's unrivaled MGM Scoring Stage space by famed engineer
Dennis Sands.
This quartet of soloists (trumpet, F horn, trombone
and tuba) received a full treatment including real legato, shorts and multiple
dynamic layers.
You will be immediately surprised by the power,
expressiveness and clarity produced by these virtuosos. Under the direction of

positions. This slider is automatically associated with the mode dial, allowing
you to instantly control the relative depth of the instrument.
Gliss mode transposes all
white keys according to the selected notes and pedal diagram. This makes it
easy to play glissandi on the white keys. When the Gliss Mode button is active,
note attacks in faster phrases are slightly attenuated. The faster you play,
the softer the attack.
Tip: By activating Gliss
mode and leaving the pedals in C major, you can play chromatically, but you can
also soften the attack of each note in the faster phrases, which makes it
possible to obtain trills, bisbigliandi and other more realistic game types."""

CinePerc PRO is a
fundamentally useful part of our large CinePerc library.
Like all "Cine"
libraries, CinePerc was recorded at the SONY Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, and
mixed by master engineer Dennis Sands.
Patches will expand your
compositing toolbox and combine perfectly with all other "Cine" series
libraries.
One of the highlights of
the CinePerc PRO library is the addition of a massive drum kit.
The main thing that sets
these kits apart from other kits is the room it was recorded in. You have a kit
that was sampled in the same room that thousands of great orchestral pieces
were recently recorded in.
This drum kit has a
legendary history and has been used on hundreds of hit movie scores as well as
some rock albums.
There are several options
in the mixer, including a Quad + LFE (4.1) to get the exact sound you're
looking for, whether it's a tight, tight sound, or a more ambient sound from
"orchestra mix", this kit can be used in any style of music.
CinePerc innovates by
adding a new "LFE / SUB" channel. With the QUAD, you can finalize a
final 4.1 mix for large cinemas.
With the LFE channel (on
most instruments), CinePerc adds the standard full mix of Dennis Sands, Close,
Overhead, Mid Room, Room and Surrounds. When the LFE is created (for low
frequency instruments), the Room and Surround transform into a QUAD Front and a
QUAD rear chain creating a perfect 4.1 environment, specially remixed by Dennis
Sands. Different microphone positions can drastically change your mix, this
also underlines the versatility of our library."""

Sound design
Keep in mind that high
values ​​of some of the settings below will tax your CPU heavily.
This is why some patches may not work properly in a fully loaded model.
There are 2 pages: MOTOR
and FX.
From the ENGINE page,
choose your sound sample from 25 categories in the drop-down menus at the top.
The sound sample is displayed in the waveform window at the top.
 AUTO MAP forces the
sample to conform to the A440 standard of your keyboard. When disabled, the
sample plays as is in Middle C.
 POSITION places the
playhead at the desired starting point in the sound sample when you press a
key.
 SMOOTH adjusts the
playhead position more smoothly.
 VOLUME controls grain
volume. Various settings can lead to a wide range of output levels.
 The MOTION command is
used to move the grains. It determines the amount of movement (forward or
backward) from the START POSITION. Lower values ​​focus on a smaller area of ​​the sound sample, resulting in a smoother texture.
+100% is a real-time reading.
 DENSITY determines how
many grains of the sample are played per second. Higher values ​​result in a smoother, fuller sound. *Higher DENSITY
values ​​also increase CPU usage.
RAND DENSITY shuffles and
randomizes the timing of each grain based on the DENSITY setting. It is a
non-quantized reading of the grains towards a more humanized reading. Higher
values ​​prevent phasing and comb filtering.
Click on TEMPO SYNC for
rhythmic synchronization with your DAW. DENSITY now adjusts the number of
grains per bar. For tempo sync patches to work in Kontakt standalone, the
transport must be running for live quantization to work."""

The collection includes
mono "Oo", "Ah" in legato and sustain, vowel
"morphs", whispered words, roars, fourths, fifths, unison legato

Recorded at famed
Firehouse Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and mixed by acclaimed engineer Tim
Starnes, the Dulcimer and Zither library will add stunning brilliance and color
to every scoring palette.
The CineSamples WORLD
SERIES: Dulcimer & Zither is a library unmatched in sound and flexibility
due to choice of instruments and recording technique.
The library was designed
by composers, for composers, with expert advice from leading film music
professionals during its development.
The library has been
meticulously recorded and designed by Tim Starnes, one of the most experienced
and recognized music publishers around the world. He has worked with most
current and former Hollywood A-list composers. His participations include
productions such as King Kong (2005), The Lord of the Rings II & III (2002,
2003), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), Remember Me (2010), Twilight:
Eclipse (2010 ), Hugo (2011), and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011).
After past successful
collaborations such as "Drums of War", CineSamples is proud to once
again have the chance to have him as recording engineer on this library.
The studios used for
Dulcimer & Zither - Firehouse Recording Studios - offer an equally
impressive pedigree, having recorded music for countless movies, TV shows and
industry veterans such as Aretha Franklin, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock and
Randy Newman, among others.
Features :
About Patches
All patches usually
contain hits and/or Snapshots recorded at different dynamics with up to 10
round robins.
Depending on the
instrument, we recorded samples using different mallets, hammers, bows,
plectrums and fingers in multiple mic positions.
Users can choose from 3
microphone positions:
 Close, Room and Full Mix
which contains a mix of Close/Room and additional microphones. We have also
carefully chosen the instruments
which needed to be
recorded in order to ensure the best sound quality.
The most prominent choice
was the dulcimer piano which was chromatically sampled (10RR) to reproduce the
typical stereo image of the instrument. We also auditioned several mallets and
made the most relevant and artistic choices.
In addition to general GUI
functions such as Delay, Reverb and Envelope Control, we also present our own
arpeggiator with this library.
This feature will give
users control over alternate arpeggio modes, including the ability to sync to
the host tempo in the user's DAW of choice.

however you want. Almost every patch will work forever if you need it. Simply

LEONID BASS is the deeply
sampled adventure of an incredible double bass (made in Italy in the 1700s),
played by accomplished bassist Leonid Finkelshteyn.
As the 4th album in the
INTIMATE STRINGS series, Leonid Bass stems from the work of Friedlander Violin,
Blakus Cello and Fischer Viola.
Embertone sampled Lenny
with depth and precision unmatched in his company's history, capturing more
detail and articulation content than in previous releases.
One of the most exciting
things about this bass is the richness and clarity of the low frequencies.
Description of the
instrument
Leonid Bass therefore
joins the Friedlander Violin, Blakus Cello and Fischer Viola, created
specifically for Kontakt 5, and it is also pre-mapped for Native Instruments
Komplete Kontrol serie S keyboards.
This new double bass bank
includes nearly 6,000 sound samples in 16 or 24 bits / 44.1 kHz stereo and
custom scripts developed by Andreas Lemke.
Leonid Bass lets you enjoy
different playing types including true legato, true portamento, con sordino,
sul ponticello and pizzicatos.
You will also find
harmonics and can control dynamics and timbre, including morphing options.
Features of the instrument
 Color Morphing
Live string players
produce a wide range of tone colors by choosing where their bow passes between
bridge and fingerboard. This instrument gives you that control!
 Vibrato improvements
Organic, emotional and
fully controllable vibrato experience.
 CPU/RAM efficiency
There have been some
crucial tweaks to our script, as well as big tweaks to group scheduling.
Leonid Bass is lighter on
RAM, and more efficient with its DC handling
 Intuitive controls
 LOW RAM MODE
Instead of cluttering up
your hard drive with a bunch of files and patches, we've added a simple LO RAM
button to the interface.
When pressed, the speed
control script is bypassed with even more RAM savings without audio quality
degradation.
 OSC KEY MODE
If you are using Touch
OSC, there is now a button directly on the GUI to sync all your CC settings.
 SPEED CONTROL
If you don't want speed
control, save RAM by turning it off. Samples still sound good and you save a
lot of RAM.
One of the "flagship"
features of the Leonid Bass is the "Dynamic Phase-Aligned Morphing"
between the pp and ff legato layers.
This allows you to
seamlessly fade through both transitions and sustains at any time during
playback.
It sounds great across the
16-20dB dynamic range that the expression control provides, depending on the
sag position.
Technical characteristics
 True Legato / Slurs /
Slides bow change
 Dynamic phase-aligned
morphing
 Watermarked for
protection
 Improved Vibrato motor
 CPU/RAM improvements
 True legato programming

with character and personality, Broadway Big Band - Kontakt Edition has
established itself as the ultimate virtual instrument for brass, reed

configurations, whether for stage or studio use, contemporary or vintage,
Broadway Big Band can do it all. It has been used by top industry
professionals on major albums, live shows, and high-profile film, television,

tool for creating Jazz, Funk, Pop, Blues, R&B, Latin, Hip-Hop , and more...
A revolutionary device
allowing polyphonic, polyrhythmic and polyphonic legato on a mixed section of
instruments. Thanks to the RTO, you can play an entire section of the keyboard,
and the notes you play are orchestrated in real time and distributed to the
various instruments of the multi RTO, according to orchestration schemes that
you can create yourself. It is an extremely powerful and easy to use system.
Ideal for live shows, as well as tracking under tight deadlines. It also offers
articulation presets that can replace the built-in key switch with alternate
midi triggers such as foot switches, freeing up your left hand to play notes
rather than touch controls.
From now on, you can use
any of Broadway's Big Band wind instruments multiple times in the arrangement
or in a multi, even in unison, creating a realistic multi-instrument section.
This means that even with
multiple instances of a single instrument, you can still get a realistic
section of multiple instruments playing in unison. This isn't some sort of
doubling effect, but rather using different samples and light tweaks to ensure
that each instance of the instrument sounds a bit different from the next. The
results are very realistic. The feature also includes "Humanize" and
"Detune" buttons for greater control over the sound of the section.
With version 2.0, "Notation
mode" was added to all Broadway Big Band instruments, to allow notation
programs to communicate with the Broadway Big Band and use it for reading sheet
music, including all articulations and dynamics included. The new Notation mode
also allows integration with Cubase Expression cards. This was not previously
possible due to Broadway Big Band's unique articulation switching system. The
new Notation mode uses an alternate key-switching system that is more in line
with the way notation programs work.

Orchestrator, Fable Sounds always keeps you up to date with the latest
technological developments.
OPTIMIZED FOR STUDIO
PRODUCTIONS

BEST NEW YORK MUSICIANS
It sounds great and feels
great because it's been played right, by accomplished New York Jazz, Salsa, Pop

NEW FEATURES IN VERSION
2.0:
REAL-TIME ORCHESTRATOR
(RTO)
A revolutionary device
allowing polyphonic and polyrhythmic legato on a mixed section of instruments.
Thanks to the RTO, you can play an entire section of the keyboard, and the
notes you play are orchestrated in real time and distributed to the various
instruments of the multi RTO, according to orchestration schemes that you can

UNISON DIVISION
From now on, you can use
any of the Broadway Lites instruments multiple times in the arrangement or in a
multi, even in unison, creating a realistic multi-instrument section. This
means that even with multiple instances of a single instrument, you can still
get a realistic section of multiple instruments playing in unison. This isn't

tweaks to ensure that each instance of the instrument sounds a bit different
from the next. The results are very realistic. The feature also includes

SCORING SOFTWARE SUPPORT
With version 2.0,
"Notation mode" was added to all Broadway Lites instruments, to allow
notation programs to communicate with Broadway Lites and use it for reading
sheet music, including all included articulations and dynamics. The new
Notation mode also allows integration with Cubase Expression cards. This was
previously not possible due to Broadway Lites unique articulation switching
system. The new Notation mode uses an alternate keyed swapping system that is
more in line with the way notation programs work. (Full documentation in the
user manual).
SPEED CURVE CONTROL
Due to the extended
dynamic range of the instruments included in the Broadway Lites, it is
sometimes difficult to maintain control over the dynamics when using velocity
from a MIDI keyboard. To help overcome this issue, we've added a new knob to
control the velocity curve, which allows you to adjust the responsiveness of
Broadway Lites instruments to different MIDI keyboards. The new Velocity Curve
Control feature can also be automated over MIDI to make changes in a song if
needed.
NEW ARTICULATION ADDED TO
TENOR SAXOPHONE 1
FP+Vibrato, added as a
temporary articulation and in combination with the existing "Strong

 A welcome addition to
any sample collection
 Cymbal and snare control

 Nine snares, six kicks,
fourteen toms and ten cymbals from different drum manufacturers.
- One Kit Wonder Aggressive
Rock: The One Kit Wonder series was inspired by the many GGD users who use our
libraries to write songs. We know how crucial it is to waste as little time as
possible between when inspiration strikes and when you are able to capture it,
and how important it is that you can hear your ideas ringing. in a precise and
professional manner to keep you excited as you develop them.
Each One Kit Wonder is
captured in the same level of detail as our other libraries, but comes fully
mixed and ready to go, so you can dive straight into songwriting creativity and
hear your ideas ringing out right away. incredible way.
One Kit Wonder: Aggressive
Rock was designed with the aim of providing an extremely powerful sounding kit
suitable for contemporary heavy rock. Inspired by bands like Beartooth, we
chose a small setup of low tuned drums and punchy, slightly trashy cymbals.
Where these drum sounds differ from the norm is that there are no layered
single samples - it's a single drum set tuned, designed and mixed to provide
the attack. brutal and shotgun-style room vibe that conveys the power and
aggressiveness necessary for the style.
- One Kit Wonder Modern
Fusion: This particular kit, One Kit Wonder: Modern Fusion is inspired by
contemporary progressive fusion artists, whose music demands a clean, bright
drum sound that nevertheless retains an organic timbre and wide dynamic range.
The snare and toms are punchy yet musical, while the kick can offer a punchy
attack or a thud depending on the dynamic range used. The cymbals are
shimmering and hi-fi, but also possess an underlying dark complexity and touch
sensitivity.
- One Kit Wonder Metal:
One Kit Wonder: Metal is designed to combine the best elements of big budget
metal productions of the early and mid 2000s, with the new levels of natural
power, realism and finish that we can find in modern drum sounds. He's a metal
chameleon, not limited to any particular subgenre, and equally at home with
backbeats as 250bpm."""

From John Williams to Hans
Zimmer, orchestral brass has been a source of strength and power in the modern
era of film music. FORZO: Heavyocity's Modern Brass was done in this image.
Recorded at legendary Skywalker Sound, FORZO is the product of Heavyocity's
world-class sound design team, in collaboration with award-winning composer
Jason Graves and Hollywood sound engineer Satoshi Mark Noguchi. This dream team
entered the hallowed halls of Skywalker with one goal in mind: to create a new
benchmark for orchestral brass.
To bring this monster to
life, FORZO first assembled an epic ensemble of world-class horns. The 12
horns, four trumpets, eight trombones (tenor, bass and double bass) and two
tubas deliver 25 GB of pure copper power straight into the hands of the
cinematic composer. Creative articulations like Cluster Bends and Random
Flutters give muscular sections in a very unique way. And if you really want to
master those explosive Brass VIs, the FORZO Full Ensemble NKI puts the entire
26-piece brass orchestra (playing at the same time, in the same room) at your
fingertips. You've heard brass, but not like this. FORZO: Modern Brass is truly
beyond the ordinary.
While FORZO's Organic
Brass is best in class, the instrument's 300+ presets wouldn't be complete
without a diverse collection of hybrid cinematic content and tempo-synced
loops. Once again, Heavyocity has taken a collection of meticulously recorded
samples and created something totally new: FORZO's hybrid side blazes a new
trail for the modern composer, as creative processing and expert sound design
crosses the line. fine line between organic and electronic.
The new Heavyocity Forzo
Modern Brass features 11,475 sound samples compiled into 9 NKI instrument
presets. For this, the team called on composer Jason Graves (Tomb Raider, Dead
Space, Far Cry Primal) and sound engineer specializing in film music, Satoshi
Mark Noguchi (Midnight Special, Lone Survivor), while this beautiful world
having found itself at Skywalker Sound (where the soundtracks of The Fountain,
Dead Space 2, Gears of War were recorded).
You are thus entitled to
the traditional French horns, trumpets, tenor/bass/double bass trombones,
tubas, with hundreds of articulations available, but also to a set of 26
instruments and two design tools: the Hybrid Brass Designer and the Brass Loop
Designer, the first offering an approach that combines music and sound design
and allows you to combine sounds, while the second offers more than 400
tempo-synchronized brass loops that you can assign to different parts of your
keyboard.
The NKS-compatible
collection for Kontakt 5.8.1 lets you mix three sounds also offers a Cycle page
to take advantage of advanced granular and rhythmic playback features, a Macro
knob lets you control multiple parameters dynamically, and you'll be able to
apply filter effects , distortion, chorus, delay, reverb, gate, equalization"""

Shreddage 3 Precision was

planning the perfect instrument and recording setup: bassist Tony Dickinson
(Trans-Siberian Orchestra) performed all the samples using a high-pitched
5-string American p-bass. level, flat-stringed for beautiful, detailed sound. A
fully analog UA|610 DI was used to enhance the warmth and fullness of each
note.
For basic playing
techniques, we captured fingering, hand and slap games with lots of dynamics
and round-robins. Add to that taps, pops, hammer-on/pull-offs, slides, buzz
trills and harmonics, and the result is a super playable instrument that can
handle almost any riff you throw at it. Whether you're writing rock, metal,
pop, funk, jazz, or blues, Shreddage 3 Precision fits any mix.
Of course, this instrument
also includes the same features as all Shreddage 3 instruments: a very

And to inaugurate this
brand new sound engine for Kontakt, Impact Soundworks chose a Fender
Stratocaster.
Impact Soundworks to
launch Shreddage 3 Stratus, a new electric guitar sample bank for Kontakt
featuring the next generation of the in-house Shreddage engine.
The Shreddage 3 engine will
be applied to guitars and basses, starting with a Stratocaster guitar.
The Shreddage 3 engine has
been completely recoded in order to exploit all the tools available in version
5.7 of Kontakt (Kontakt 6 has just been released, it will certainly be necessary
to wait for an update or the following banks to exploit the new Native effects
in particular) .
The novelties include the
improvement of the "virtual hand" which manages the position of the
fingers, with the possibility of automating the choice of the string and the
fret to be played.
New "fretting"
algorithms and the possibility of setting the range of frets will make it
possible to adapt the playing, and therefore the sound and the realism, to the
different styles.
Impact Soundworks has also
listened to users and simplified chord playing with a new Strumming engine: the
low notes of the keyboard are reserved for configuring the chord and the high
notes for triggering the strum, with the addition of a "Partial
Strums" function. " which allows not to strum all the strings, or the
possibility of choosing single notes in the chord.
Another big chunk of this
new generation, a Console makes an appearance so you can mix all four
channels/mix mics; There are 8 inserts per channel, eight send channels and a
modular effects rack with 30 effects (amps and pedals, EQs, modulation,
dynamics processing).
The section dedicated to
virtual cabinets is also getting a makeover and will offer new impulse
responses from 8 cabinets (Mesa/Boogie, Marshall, Fender, Vox, etc.) captured
with at least two microphones (dynamic and condenser) and two positions (full
axis and off-axis). IRs from Shreddage 2 will also be included.
To finish with the new
features, a preset manager will allow you to use settings in other Shreddage 3
banks.
Which brings us to the
bank management system, Impact Soundworks also aiming for simplicity. The
developer eventually wants to integrate all of its current (and hopefully new)
virtual basses and guitars into the Shreddage 3 series."""

 SUSTAINS The simplest
playing technique is a linear sustain without extra embellishments.
 SUSTAIN TONGUEDA
Slightly more accentuated sustain technique with a faster, airier attack.
 VIBRATO Two forms of
vibrato are included in the library: breath (executed by modifying the amount
of air blown into the instrument), and soft (generated by the Kontakt).  All
of these shapes primarily affect the volume of the instrument rather than its
pitch.
 FLUTTERA tremolo
technique which consists of rolling the tongue while playing a sustained note.
 SUSTAIN BEND UPA Gradual
bend to a sustained pitch. Playing at higher speeds will trigger faster curves.
 SUSTAIN ORNAMENTED LONGA
Series of ornaments in the pitch before ending on a sustained note.
 SUSTAIN ORNAMENTED

positions (room and close), various articulations with or without vibrato,
multiple ornaments and several release articulations (normal sustain, tongued
sustain, accented sustain, trill sustain, bend up, bend down, acc .bend up,
acc.bend down). All articulations are assignable via MIDI CC. In the main
section, you will find tone settings, a monodic or polyphonic mode, a knob to
adjust the release time of the notes played, as well as various parameters such
as the offset of the samples, the activation or not of the pedal sustain, etc.
Regarding ornaments, you can adjust the attack and release, as well as the
probability that these will be played. In the loops section, settings for
dynamics, transposition, speed, as well as an ADSR envelope are offered. You
can also choose the looping mode (one-shot, round trip or loop).
30 effect modules are available to you in the Console
section. Choose from EQs, compressors, amp emulations, delays, distortion,
reverb, and more.

A musical journey through
the history of Trinidad and Tobago´s
In the aftermath of the
abolition of slavery in the Caribbean, indentured laborers from the East Indies
arrived with another culture in the melting pot of the West Indies. The most
important element they brought with them was their musical identity. East
Indian indentured laborers came mainly from the Hindu belt to cultivate the sugar
plantations, mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname and Guyana.
This sample library
includes the two major musical subgenres that emerged in the history of West
Indian Creole musical innovations, both the result of the presence of East
Indian immigrants in the Caribbean.
Chutney music evolved from
Bhojpuri folk music. The main instruments used are the harmonium, the dhantal
and the dholak. This traditional Chutney is the original and organic form of
expression of the Indian diaspora in the Caribbean. Chutney's melodies and
beats have evolved over the years to accommodate changing technology and tastes
while evolving with advancements in the carnival industry, giving rise to the
crossover genre of Chutney-Soca. However, Chutney still retains the frenetic
rhythms of the dholak, the melodic passages and soothing hums of the harmonium
as well as the traditional melodies and arrangements. At your fingertips is a
library of authentic dholak, dhantal, and harmonium samples and loops. Vocal
samples of ad-libs and popular expressions are also included to help you bring
that instant cachet to your productions.
Tassa drums evolved from
the Plains of North and Central India. The main instruments used are the Dhol
or bass drum, the Caribbean equivalent of the nagara known as the kutter drum,
and the Jhanj cymbal. Tassa's infectious beat has become synonymous with
partying in the Twin Islands Republic. The thundering bass accompanied by the
piercing kutter awakens the body to put itself at its service. The Tassa is the
mainstay of all traditional Indian weddings and festivities. It now adapts
perfectly to any audio production. Its contagious effect can be applied to all
percussive sets and ideas.

sounds.
The instruments were
recorded in different spaces in Los Angeles (studios, rooms, tunnels) in 192
kHz then mixed and sampled in 24 bits / 48 kHz. The teams captured them with
five different tunings, several round robins and made two mixes of the
microphone positions (close mix and far mix) for each of the dynamic layers.
Strikeforce has several
particularities regarding the use and mixing of sets and instruments. In
particular, you have two round robin reading modes, serial or random, as well
as a matrix to select the round robins. Another peculiarity, the control of the
microphone positions per dynamics layer affects some of the parameters of the
instruments, in particular the compression ratio, the equalization and the
reverb tail, in order to obtain a more musical rendering.
Laboratory Audio adds that
the number of musicians increases with the dynamic layers (from two for the ppp
layer to ten for the fff), the Size: of the set will therefore vary with your
playing. Finally, you can vary the Size yourself : of the whole in 115 of the
patches offered thanks to a special configuration, taking advantage for each of

AMATI VIOLA is part of
Native Instruments' Cremona Quartet series. A violin-making pioneer, Andrea
Amati is widely regarded as the inventor of the violin as we know it. His son
Gerolamo continued this tradition in the family workshop in Cremona and built
the "Stauffer" viola in 1614, making it the oldest instrument in the
Cremona Quartet series. During the long process of recording this virtual
instrument, the streets of Cremona were deserted, as the municipality closed
roads and parking lots and urged the townspeople to remain as quiet as
possible. Meanwhile, in the Giovanni Arvedi Auditorium, designed by pioneering
acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, Hamburg Electronic Instruments captured every note
of the viola using 32 carefully selected microphones placed around the room to
provide this digital reconstruction of an ahistorical masterpiece. The
instrument offers 20 different, professionally played articulations, each with
up to five legatotransitions. Additionally, the innovative,
performance-captured Vibrato models the natural vibrato technique of a
professional player, and phase-aligned stereo Dynamic Crossfades eliminate
phasing between dynamic transitions. These characteristics make AMATI VIOLA one
of the most realistic and faithful recreations of a solo viola.
Every articulation of every
note was recorded using a bespoke array of microphones placed in a specially
designed acoustic environment in the Giovanni Arvedi Auditorium. Even the
inhabitants of Cremona contributed, since all road traffic near the auditorium
was stopped during the recordings.
e-instruments is the
creator of SESSION STRINGS and SESSION HORNS. He specializes in the design of
particularly detailed sampled instruments. He initiated the CREMONA QUARTET

is a treasure trove for producers looking for instant soul for their tracks.

All loops are perfectly
sliced ​​and tempo-synced, and you can easily edit and
rearrange all slices to create countless phrase variations - providing an
immediate harmonic foundation without requiring advanced musicality for your
hip-hop, R&B or electronic tracks soulful.
This instrument contains
Acoustic, Rhodes, Wurlitzer and Clavinet pianos recorded by George Duke and his
personal engineer Erik Zobler, using highly sought-after vintage equipment. Two
versions of each phrase are available - clean and 'Tubes & Tapes'. The
signal was routed through various analog outboard gear before finally being
sent through a Requisite Audio tube optical limiter, and recorded onto Ampex
analog tape - adding that authentic, warm soul-brother flavor.

Tapes recording channels
FLEXIBLE MODIFICATION AND
REORGANIZATION
Each phrase is divided
into multiple slices, which can be individually triggered from any point in the
loop, making it easy to rearrange and create countless variations. Sound
parameters such as melody, volume, attack and stretch can be adjusted on the
fly, with each step visible via the waveform display.
Timing is flexible -
KONTAKT's timestretch delivers pleasingly smooth results. You can also drag and
drop a MIDI file into your host sequencer - including timing information to
trigger slices - giving you maximum flexibility when building and finalizing
tracks in a DAW.
Eight different filter
types and a studio-grade convolution reverb provide additional sonic
possibilities, with each effects chain triggerable via a MIDI keyboard.

the region. CREMONA QUARTET is a collection of four precious stringed
instruments dating back to the 17th century, which captures and preserves every

Stradivari may be the most

the inhabitants of Cremona contributed, since all road traffic near the
auditorium was stopped during the recordings.

The sincerity and emotion
of the human voice captured to generate tension, transitions and waves of

Choose from over 800 sound
sources specially captured from 45 hours of choir recording sessions, and
organized into over 600 sound layers.
Control the emotional
impact of complex moods or build clusters and chords from perfectly usable
tonal notes.
TAMES THE HUMAN VOICE
MYSTERIA is a unique
instrument for screen music that captures the unique ability of the human voice
to convey emotion directly. Play atypical and mysterious textures live, and use
an unearthly collection of choruses, voices and textures to create shifts of
vivid tension, angelic progressions and dizzying transitions, all driven by
human nature. MYSTERIA harnesses hours of never-before-seen recordings of
curated choirs to cover the full spectrum of human emotions - from the most
intimate to the most sublime.
The X/Y control is the
heart of MYSTERIA. The x-axis is used to morph between sound sources, while the
y-axis increases the emotional intensity depending on the sounds you use. So
you can create anything from ever-changing atmospheres to fast-moving dynamics,
intimate vocal variations, or even epic walls of sound using just one intuitive
control.
GENERATES ATMOSPHERES
Atmospheres are evolving
textures that can be used to create variations in intensity and emotion. You
can play with 350+ masterfully crafted presets, or go into detail and create
custom sound layers piece by piece from over 800 separate sources. Mix,
modulate and tune them according to the mood requested, then return to
Performance mode to control and compose your music live. Adjust how sounds mix
and layer to control how they evolve, or use the randomize function to explore
the collection and find the perfect mood.
CLUSTER DESIGNER
The Cluster Designer is an
advanced tool for granular control of vocals within a fully actionable tonal
cluster. Changes the way certain sounds build, melodically morph, and evolve,
using the X/Y pad; you can even create chords and musical groupings to add an
extra dose of expressiveness. Choose from customizable presets or start from
scratch with up to eight voices that can be individually tuned and panned. The
three play modes - Glide, Add-on and Parallel - each process the cluster in
different ways to vary the sound effects.
THE STORY OF MYSTERIA
The sounds that give
MYSTERIA its voice were painstakingly recorded during 45 hours of studio
sessions in Bratislava and Cologne with some of Europe's finest choirs. The
sessions included a large symphonic choir to achieve intense and epic clusters.
It was also split into male and female choirs. A chamber choir produced clearer
sounds, and the New Music vocal quartet brought closeness and intimacy to some
of MYSTERIA's more subtle sounds.

RETRO SOUND, MODERN
PERFORMANCE
RETRO MACHINES MK2 is a
collection of 16 passionately sampled analog synthesizers and keyboards honed
for the market-leading sampling platform, KONTAKT 5.
The collection brings
together classic, distinctive and exotic instruments that laid the foundations
of the electronic pop sound of the 70s and 80s.
RETRO MACHINES MK2 gives
you the massive, creamy, analog sound of the era without the maintenance
requirements and with all the benefits of state-of-the-art software
technologies.
Instrument Details
SOUND CONTROL
The interface of each of
these analog dinosaurs offers full control over all parameters.
Presets capture the
original character of each instrument and offer eight sound variations.
Each variation corresponds
to a ready-to-use synthesizer sound, resulting from a particular combination of
parameters including OSC, filter and amp.
Your settings are saved in
their smallest variations.
Use the Morph slider to
switch between variations and add dynamism to your sound.
ARPEGIATOR AND CHORD
PLAYER
The arpeggiator supplied
with the RETRO MACHINES MK2 is a modern reinterpretation of the original
arpeggiators.
You can choose between
16-note mode or 12-note triplet mode and set the velocity of each note.
You can also assign a
different sound to each note of the arpeggio, for a particularly dynamic and
expressive rendering.
The Chord Player creates
chords from single notes and is extremely useful when combined with the
arpeggiator.
In Fixed Chord mode, set
your own intervals and play chords up and down the keyboard with just one
finger.
When Fixed Chord mode is
off, you must choose a key pattern; the chords you hear are automatically
matched to the selected key, creating perfect and elegant harmonies."""

With the BALINESE GAMELAN
extension, the Discovery series offers you a new cultural journey, this time
exploring Indonesia to discover the musical universe of Balinese Gamelan. This
instrument contains 2 Go of samples of exceptional quality, coming from various
essential instruments constituting the Gamelan. Compatible with the free
KONTAKT PLAYER (and usable with KONTAKT as well), this instrument recreates the
rich, complex textures of Gamelan in its classic form, sampled with exquisite
refinement; it also offers many features to modify and manipulate sounds in new
directions. Created by acclaimed sound design studio Soniccouture, the sound of
the BALINESE GAMELAN expansion seamlessly integrates with different musical
genres and production styles - from TV and film production soundtracks to
electronic music tracks, as well as to classical compositions for Gamelan.
A BRIEF PRESENTATION - THE
MUSIC OF THE GAMELAN The Gamelan (often translated as orchestra) is an
ensemble of instruments originating from Indonesia, generally from Java or
Bali. These ensembles can differ significantly, but are frequently composed of
a combination of metallophones, xylophones, drums, and gongs, as well as bamboo
flutes, bowed or plucked strings, and even a vocalist. Each instrument was made
and tuned to play in that particular ensemble; tunings can therefore vary
considerably from one Gamelan to another. One of the most salient features of
Balinese Gamelan is that each instrument is paired, with each pair being
slightly out of tune. This creates a natural pulse between the different
instruments - arguably the oldest chorus effect on the planet. Culturally,
Balinese Gamelan is strongly associated with religion; it is an integral part
of many Hindu ceremonies and is frequently performed during secular
celebrations and festivals. Balinese Gamelan differs significantly from the
more subdued, more "refined" style of its Javanese counterpart -
perhaps due to the different religious climates prevailing in these two
islands. Gamelan music is often characterized by its bright, metallic and
percussive sonorities, its distinctive and complex tuning, the rich layering of
its instruments and its cyclic form. The instruments themselves are often of
exceptional beauty; the Indonesian tradition considers that the Gamelan is a
sacred ensemble, each instrument of which is guided by the spirits.
BALINESE GAMELAN - THE
INSTRUMENT
The instruments of this
extension have been sampled with incredible refinement, with the collaboration
of the Semara Dana Gamelan ensemble of the London Symphony Orchestra. This
time-consuming process has preserved the organic, pulsating sound of the
instruments perfectly, thanks to the incredibly meticulous recording of many
layers of velocity - a phenomenal job done by Soniccouture. This instrument
includes the three main elements of the large ensemble that makes up the
Gamelan and focuses on compact versions of the tuned instruments, as well as
the large gongs, paired metallophones and bronze drums. Instruments can be divided
into the following categories:
The Central Instruments:
Responsible for the main structure and melody, the central instruments include
the Gongs, the Jegog, the Calung and the Penyacah. This instrument includes
both the upper and lower groups of these detuned pairs; volume and pan
positioning can be easily controlled from the Kontakt interface.
The Gangsa: The Gangsa is
made up of paired metallophones, including Ugal, Pemadé and Kantilan. These are
energetic and complex instruments, which adorn the main melody with
intertwining and rapid motifs. Again, KONTAKT's interface provides easy access
to volume and panning controls for these detuned pairs.
The bronze drums: The
third element of the BALINESE GAMELAN instrument is formed by the bronze drums,
which include the Trompong and the Reyong. These instruments have different
functions, depending on the type of Gamelan in which they are used. They are
sometimes used for melodic ornamentation or solo passages, and other times for
the interpretation of very fast and complex passages, such as the Gangsa.
The BALINESE GAMELAN
instrument makes perfect use of the flexibility offered by the free KONTAKT
PLAYER and KONTAKT. Choose from the two different tones available - 'Full
Version', for classic Balinese Gamelan tuning, and 'Concert', for a more
'Westernized' tuning, making it easy to layer Gamelan instruments with Western
sounds. A "Synth" version, available as an option, offers the
possibility of adjusting various parameters of the instruments, so as to manipulate
them beyond their natural sound. The Jammer function acts as an arpeggiator,
creating rhythmic arpeggios easily manipulated using the parameter controls;
another function allows easy control of the volume and pan positioning of the
two detuned elements of the Gangsa or the central instruments.

is the perfect blend of precision and ambience, while providing the versatility
and playability to meet the needs of any orchestral production task. It also
features an outstanding percussion set for pop and electronic music.
With a huge range of
classic and more exotic percussion instruments, varied articulations, and a
powerful drumhead resonance simulation feature, PERCUSSION is the ultimate line
of orchestral rhythm tools. An ultra-detailed transient-enhancing pickup mic is
added to four distinct room setups, to provide the depth and versatility needed
to work on any type of composition, in any musical genre.
RESONANCE SIMULATION
PERCUSSION uses a unique
playback and sampling system for unprecedented realism. Drum Head Resonance
Simulation (DHRS) intelligently alternates between hit recordings on stationary
drum heads and recordings with resonant drum heads. Random draws of samples
called round robins can also be used to recreate the sound of drums in a very realistic
way, while integrating adjustments for style and performance.
55 INSTRUMENTS, 7 SETS
This very wide palette of
percussion offers symphonic classics such as timpani, snare drum and concert
toms, as well as tonal percussion such as celesta, marimba and vibraphone, and
even hand percussion such as agogô, the quijada, the "temple blocks"
and much more. Each instrument can be played alone or via one of seven
ingeniously composed kits.
Articulations
Up to 7 per instrument,
including:
Crescendo Rolls, Edge
Variations, Flam, FX, Release Sample Muted, Tremolo
 Number of NKIs - 66
including 7 kits
 Mic configurations - 4:
Close, Medium, Far, Spot and Stereo Master Mix with independent mixing,
routing, panning and loading."""

cotton offers a louder attack with more harmonics.

sections:
 Workbench lets you add
harmonics, embed reverse samples, manage resonance, add ambient and mechanical
noise (including pedals and the breath of the pianist himself) and even push
further preparation with the addition of a second material (leather, silk,
curtain fabric, etc.). You will also be able to create textures and percussion effects
using these options without the piano sounds.
 Response gives you the
ability to shape the sound by adjusting attack, resonance, incorporating
harmonics, changing the velocity curve, pedal mode, changing tuning and
temperament (equal or extended) of the piano, etc

Hailing from the 80s, this
blazing red electric guitar emanates clean chorus tones and jagged leads that
last a lifetime. Quite literally, in fact, as the guitar includes a sustain
pickup that allows notes to ring out endlessly. Although it may seem like a
novelty at first, the sustainer pickup actually adds a lot of options for
effects that can't be achieved with a regular guitar. For example, chords can
be held in conjunction with the volume pedal to create organic pad-like tones.
In high gain lead guitar sounds, the sustain sensor sometimes causes harmonics
to sound, almost like guitar amp feedback.
We sampled all
articulations with a generous amount of sustain, then looped the applicable
samples using phase-consistent loop points.
As you can imagine, for a
guitar that specializes in lead guitar leads, we were sure to sample everything
from pinch and tap harmonics to glides and other performance effects. We also
recorded the legato articulations with four round-robins for realistic
variation when playing quick trills.
Evolution Infinity is
equipped with our Evolution guitar engine which gives you a wealth of features:
an innovative strumming pattern editor, automatic chord detection and a robust
effects engine. The library includes plenty of factory presets for ready-to-use

Berlin Orchestra Inspire
is based on the Berlin Series, which has been developed over the past 5 years.
Today it is one of the largest and most detailed collections of orchestral
samples in the world, used by many composers around the world and in countless
Hollywood productions.
Recorded with
world-renowned Berlin musicians on the beautiful Teldex Scoring Stage, this
collection of virtual orchestral instruments enables the most believable MIDI

Players
from Berlin's world famous orchestras have been selected for the BST sampling
sessions.
A large and
comprehensive articulation menu includes true legato intervals, expressive
portions, octave shifts, and spiccato delivery.
Compatible
with Berlin Woods.
Berlin
Strings is divided into first violins, second violins (with a different set of
players), violas, cellos and basses.
Each of the
five sections has between 20 and 38 patches covering a generous selection of
performance styles, many of which have switchable key variations
The samples
were recorded from four main microphone positions: Close, Tree, Surround, and
the mysteriously named 'A/B', for alternate wide stereo imaging. Additionally,
the First Violins have a mono Concertmaster pickup trained on Berlin Strings'
lead violinist Cornelius Katzer; this extra mic position has its own volume and
pan controls, so you can give that excellent player more prominence in the mix.
Features
 Adaptive
Legato Engine
Berlin
Strings features an innovative new legato system that analyzes your performance
to choose between four types of legato:
 Blurred
expressive legato
Light
nimble and quick (scripted) quick runs legato portamento
With
velocity, you control the different intensities of captured bow strokes (soft
attack, immediate attack, accentuated attack). With the sustain pedal, you can
add a soft decay to end a phrase. These release samples were specifically
recorded. Also, the faster you play, the blurrier the intonation will be, just
like in a real string performance. These fuzzy intonation effects will be
created by specifically sampled articulations. Via a CC of your choice, you can
switch between different vibrato expressions.
For Berlin
Strings, we decided to choose smaller Section Size:s to retain vibrato
definition and detail in the sampled patches. Multiple crossfade techniques
(dynamic layers, legatos fade scripts, vibrato fade) or playing more than one
voice leads to a fatter, pad-like undefined string sound. With smaller sections
we try to take this effect into the calculation to end up with a detailed and
expressive orchestral section.
Berlin
Strings consists of the following sections:
 1st
Violin (8 players)
 2nd
Violins (6 players)
 Viola (5
players)
 Celli (5
players)
 Basses (4
players)
Bow Noise
Add natural
DC-controllable arcing sound for added expressiveness.
Fuzzy
articulations
We've
recorded special, untuned, fuzzy articulations that you can mix in like a sound
color to change the feel of intonation in a phrase.
Chain races
Berlin
Strings features playable track patches, as well as pre-recorded octave runs,
which automatically match your host's tempo.

After Colours: Animator

ADAPTIVE RUNS is the
smartest and most intuitive orchestral track library yet. Drawing from a vast
audio repertoire, with tracks ranging from 4th to 4 octave range, ADAPTIVE RUNS
seamlessly and effortlessly syncs with your track, allowing you to focus on
your composition.
Our Adaptive Sync engine
effortlessly synchronizes orchestral passages to the next downbeat or a custom
number of beats or seconds. The engine automatically chooses the recording that
best matches, then refines it to a perfect match. Disabling sync automatically
reloads samples in disk streaming mode, a useful feature in low RAM situations.
The Range switch allows
you to quickly switch to a performance with a narrower or wider orchestrated
range, while maintaining the other timing settings.
The interface is divided
into 5 sections:
 Adaptive Synch: choose
from 3 different synchronization modes (Downbeat, Beats or Secs)
 Sections: choose the
instruments you want to play: First and second violin ensembles, viola and
cello ensembles, an ensemble of 3 flutes and a piccolo, a solo piccolo, 3
oboes, an ensemble of 3 clarinets and 3 bassoons, an ensemble of 3 trumpets
 Mics: 4 microphone

 Control: set the
velocity, the tone, as well as the direction that your runs take (Up or Down)
 Envelope & Effects:
adjust the sound envelope, and set the equalizer, reverb, panning and limiter
that are at your disposal
Advanced controls allow
you to set various keyswitches and MIDI CC assignments. To help you use

From the full orchestra to

3: Lumina 3 is the latest volume in the Symphobia range, and which brings its
share of novelty to perfect this exceptional set. Each volume is completely
independent and does not require the purchase of previous volumes.
The depth of the ensembles
composed of the orchestra and the choirs, finely sampled and assembled to form
bewitching orchestral textures, plunges you into a dreamlike, mysterious or
esoteric universe. Solo instruments like the oboe, clarinet, or rarer
instruments like a Celtic harp allow you to customize your compositions.
Each of the layers of
Lumina's atmospheres and textures can be individualized, so as to keep only the
patterns you want. Each Layer is assigned to a note and can be triggered at
any time with each having its own volume. You thus keep a total freedom of
games in your compositions, while having if you wish, the possibility of using
its atmospheres as it is, the choice is yours.

Fans of the orchestral
sound of ProjectSAM will be able to complete their collection with a fourth
bank called Pandora.
Give your action, sci-fi,
and horror a boost with the fourth volume in ProjectSAM's acclaimed Symphobia
series. Pandora lets you summon cinematic risers, heralding drops, and
mind-blowing crescendos with unparalleled ease and flexibility. Pandora's
innovative Adaptive Sync quickly and effortlessly adapts its huge library of
articulations and effects to your sequence - so your next deadline doesn't have
to be a nightmare. Plus, fully customizable sound design tools help you quickly
sculpt the timbres you want.
Pre-recorded crescendos
and rolls sound great. But they had a downside: they weren't very flexible. Any
composer will recognize the trial and error process of pushing a crescendo note
until it ends in the right place. It's a tedious task that most of us would
rather skip if we could.
Symphobia 4: Pandora is
full of transitional samples - sounds that progress dynamically or
directionally over time - ranging from powerful brass crescendos to dissonant
string risers. These samples all have one thing in common: a distinct musical
ending or climax.
COMBOS: Watch out for the
volume!
Combining articulations,
effects, beats and percussion from the library, Pandora's Combos contain some
of the greatest orchestral ensembles you've ever heard. All of the elements
inside a Combo are able to communicate directly with each other, enabling
musical magic such as the on-the-fly alignment of a col legno tube over the top
of a brass crescendo. Or a big tutti diminuendo at the end of a climb.
Combinations with multiple
Adaptive Sync instruments provide the ability to link their sync parameters.
This allows you to set the duration and timing of the entire set with a single
set of controls.

bass, piano and percussion. A selection of samples from Lumina, Symphobia's

Instrument Features and
Details
TIMPANI
The timpani is one of the
largest banks of instruments in True Strike.
You will find a long list
of playing techniques: up to 6 dynamics, sustained and attenuated notes,
tremolo, tremolo crescendo in three lengths, crescendo-decrescendo and hard
mallet fortissimo.
Suspenseful special
effects such as pedal and cymbal/bowl bends on timpani.
GRAN CASSA & SNARES
True Strike is intended
for cinematic use.
Therefore, the gran casa
and snare set are the most powerful and deepest recordings you will find.
Load the mic on stage or
from afar and scare those aliens back to their home world.
The library also includes
snare samples (snares on and off), military drums, and field drums.
SET HITS
One of the most popular
patches in True Strike is the Ensemble Hits bank.
They are ensemble
recordings of casa gran and weakly tuned timpani playing together.
MELODIC INSTRUMENTS
True Strike covers five
melodic percussion instruments: glockenspiel, marimba, vibraphone, tube bells
and celesta.
This last, beautiful
instrument is the very first sampled in a concert hall and offered in 3
microphone positions.
SMALL PERCUSSION
True Strike offers an
extensive set of small percussion instruments, including 4 wooden tablets, 5
temple blocks, whip, barchimes, bells, 4 cowbells, triangle, tambourine,
castanets and sleds."""

Impact Soundworks is best
known for its guitar banks but has recently used its talents in the development
of other virtual instruments.
In order to keep a more
homogeneous catalog, the team decided to open Red Room Audio, a brand that
focuses almost exclusively on orchestral banks, always for Kontakt, but also
Kontakt Player and NKS is supported.
Red Room Audio takes its
first steps with the Palette series, a range that currently has four banks of
orchestral instruments aimed at creating cinematic music.
The concept of Palette -
Melodics is simple. We studied the scores of several of our favorite classical
and modern film score composers (which was a most enjoyable exercise!) and
selected 18 of the most evocative combinations and instruments. We recorded a
violin section that plays octaves, royal trumpets with horns, flutes and
playful piccolos, a bass clarinet and contrabassoon octaves, a gigantic and
frightening set of bass strings and low brass and a lot of 'others. We thought
it was also important to include soloists as they are so often used to play a

library have real legato (the exception being our Trombones & Tuba).
You are not, however,
limited to using "Melodics" for melodies. The instruments feature up
to 12 common articulations (most include 4 different types of short notes!) and
can therefore also be used for traditional orchestral writing to add unique
color to your compositions.
Our soloists were recorded
in a standard orchestral seated position with 3 microphone perspectives - near,
overhead and room. For combos, we've added a second close-in mic (4 mics total)
so you have some control over each individual instrument. The room is spacious
but fairly dry, with just 1.2 seconds of tail, allowing easy mixing with other
libraries using your favorite reverbs, so you're not limited to the sound of a
particular room. As "Palette - Melodics" was recorded by the same
musicians and the production team with the same equipment and in the same room,
it was designed to integrate perfectly with all other Palette libraries."""

Impact Soundworks is best
known for its guitar banks but has recently used its talents in the development
of other virtual instruments.
In order to keep a more
homogeneous catalog, the team decided to open Red Room Audio, a brand that
focuses almost exclusively on orchestral banks, always for Kontakt, but also Kontakt
Player and NKS is supported.
Red Room Audio takes its
first steps with the Palette series, a range that currently has four banks of
orchestral instruments aimed at creating cinematic music.
"Palette - Runs &
Arps" is the most in-depth virtual instrument for real recorded
(unscripted) orchestral scales and arpeggios ever assembled. We felt there was
simply no better way to capture the emotion and subtle nuances of these unique
articulations than to record them in their entirety, rather than trying to
cleverly combine samples to produce phrases. artificial. That's why we went the
extra mile by recording string and woodwind ensembles playing scales in 6
primary modes - Major, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Whole Tone
and Chromatic - each with up to 13 variations . There are also 20 kinds of
arpeggios in 4 modes - Major, Minor, Diminished and Augmented. Each run/arp has
2 round robins and can be run in every key and can sync to your host's tempo.
In total, "Palette - Runs & Arps" includes more than 1600
performances!
The modern, easy-to-use
graphical interface always displays the notation of the current performance or
arp so you can see exactly what the orchestra is doing. For composers creating
demos and intending to deliver finished scores to an orchestra, we've also
included the ability to drag and drop MIDI data for each performance onto your
audio software. You can also use it to easily layer performances with other
samples. We've added several handy settings features like Downbeat Sync, which
ensures that the final note of the performance always arrives at count 1 of the
next bar. Tempo controls allow you to sync your host's tempo or adjust the BPM
manually. The "In Quantize" button quantizes the beginning of the
performance to the note value of your choice. There's also a powerful 8-slot FX
rack where you can choose from 19 high-quality FX.
As with the entire Palette
range, our players were recorded in a standard orchestral seated position with
3 microphone perspectives - near, decca tree and room. The room is spacious but
fairly dry, with just 1.2 seconds of tail, allowing easy mixing with other
libraries using your favorite reverbs, so you're not limited to the sound of a
particular room. As "Palette - Runs & Arps" was recorded by the
same musicians and the production team with the same equipment and in the same
room, it was designed to fit perfectly with all of Palette's other libraries."""

Bluegrass fiddle is a
distinctive American style characterized by bold, bluesy improvisation, offbeat
"chopping," and the sophisticated use of old-time double stops and
twirling patterns. The notes are often slipped, a technique rarely used in
Celtic styles. Bluegrass violinists tend to ignore the rules violinists follow:
they hold the violin the "wrong" way and often don't use the chin and
shoulder rests.
We traveled right into the
heart of the Bluegrass State for our Bluegrass fiddle - Clay City, Kentucky -
to the private studio of one of the biggest names in Bluegrass music, Rickey
Wasson. Rickey connected us with a true Bluegrass fiddle legend,
multi-instrumentalist Ronnie Stewart. Ronnie has appeared on hundreds of
records and toured with some of the biggest names in the genre. Working with
Rickey & Ronnie has been an honor and a real pleasure.

The Traveler Celtic Fiddle
uses the same configuration, but this time with a traditional Irish fiddle
played by Niall Murphy. The bank this time contains seven standard
articulations, 13 traditional ornamentations and more than 360 phrases and
effects, for a total of 5,725 sound samples.
The fiddle is one of the
most important instruments in Celtic music. The "Fiddle" itself is
identical to the fiddle, but it is played differently in widely varying
regional styles. Compared to the classical violin, Celtic violinists tend to
use vibrato very little. The melodies are embellished with forms of
ornamentation, such as cuts, rolls, and a variety of graceful notes. Slow tunes
are sometimes performed, but the style is best known for fast, punchy spools
and jigs.
For our Celtic fiddle, we
traveled to Dublin, Ireland, where we had the honor of working with
award-winning fiddler Niall Murphy. Niall has established a reputation in
traditional Irish folk circles as a performer and session musician. A veteran
of the traditional scene, he has shared the stage with The Chieftains, Sinead
O'Connor, Van Morrison, The Dubliners, Alison Krauss and many others. We also

Buenos Aires, Argentina by the famous composer Guillermo Guareschi. It is a
"Premier" bandoneon with a soft and expressive sound. A Neumann
microphone was in charge of the left hand register where all the low notes are
generated, plus an additional ribbon microphone that handles the very low
frequencies. The right hand was captured by a modified SE A5600 II tube
microphone and an AKG was tuned to capture the natural ambience of the
recording space in the treble. All microphones were connected to vintage
Telefunken preamplifiers which delivered the signal directly with no console or
black box in the chain. The recordings were all made in 24 bits 48Khz. Using

Here is the Classic
EP-88S, subtitled The BIG Electric Piano, a reference to the late George Duke
with whom Scarbee was in contact at the beginning of the project and who had
told him about the various modifications made to his Marks, before
disappearing.
To achieve this new
version, Scarbee surrounded himself with a friendly and family team. They
restored two instruments, kept the second one and spent over 6 months
recording, editing and cleaning the samples in Scarbee's studio.
The result is a bank of
8,294 sound samples that cover all 88 keys of the keyboard with 30 velocity
layers. The designer has also integrated new features, including a system for
managing release samples, another for resonance, a final one to reproduce the
behavior of the sustain pedal and to compensate for the somewhat rapid arrival
of the release when you play. on your MIDI keyboard, a note delay off function
has been integrated.
Scarbee has also included
45 snapshots and 117 effects presets and you can route the effects before or
after the amp. Finally, you will find a Zone EQ and a stereo management knob
taken from modifications made to George Duke's instruments. On the effects
side, you will find wah, compressor, overdrive, chorus, phaser, flanger, rotary
effect, cabinet and tape simulation, delay and reverb.
The new Scarbee Classic
EP-88S is an instrument for Kontakt 5, it is also pre-mapped for Komplete

The design of SCARBEE FUNK
GUITARIST took more than twelve months. The module represents a real revolution
in the world of guitar samples. The creation process was extremely meticulous:
a total of 3411 chords were recorded. For each chord, there are several
velocity levels, up to 11 articulations and different playing and microphone
positions, which can total up to 152 samples per chord. In the end, the
instrument is provided with an organic and genuinely funky sound - it is almost
impossible to hear the difference with a real guitar.
SCARBEE FUNK GUITARIST is
a tribute to the team involved: Thomas Skarbye, guitarist Soren Reiff and
scripting expert Nils Liberg.
Imagine the perfect funk

SCARBEE JAY-BASS is not
just a collection of static samples.
Based on the recording of
a Jazz bass from the late 70s (played on all strings), this instrument
reproduces the variations in timbre linked to the position of the fingers on
the neck of a real bass.
JAY-BASS thus offers a
rich, lively sound and is so realistic that you can glide from one chord to
another.
Recorded via a direct box,
SCARBEE JAY-BASS demonstrates a remarkable adaptability and blends easily into
the mix, with or without additional processing.
SCARBEE JAY-BASS is the
go-to sample source for slapped and fingered bass.
This newest member of the
"Powered by KONTAKT" line is a 70s jazz bass played and sampled by
experts.

and Alicia Keys.
Its trademark sound design
has become synonymous with quality and playability, and its sampled instruments
have become the obvious choice for many top producers and musicians around the
world. Based on Scarbee Red Bass, it makes extensive use of the advanced
scripting features implemented in SCARBEE PRE-BASS.
With samples for all three
pickup positions and a host of playing techniques, SCARBEE JAY-BASS gives you
everything you need for slapped or fingered bass.

Additionally, the bass strings have been sampled over their entire length, in
order to reproduce the changes in timbre that occur when transitioning between
low and high frets, thus producing a rich and natural sound, with all the
partials.
SCARBEE MM-BASS is more
than just a collection of samples. This instrument features a full set of
playing techniques including sustain, mute, harmonics, hammer-on, pull-off,
slides and more.
Thanks to sophisticated

Landforms is more than
just a library of orchestral samples. It is a complex orchestral sound design
environment. While conventional orchestral libraries statically reproduce
traditional orchestral sounds, Landforms embraces the unique possibilities and
idiosyncrasies of working orchestral samples. The focus is not just on
executing beautiful acoustic textures. It's about taking these textures through
unique layers of processing to create abstract, ever-changing sonic collages.
It's grounded in the orchestral realm, but simultaneously feels alien and
unique.
Influenced by the shapes
and textures of the natural world, the articulations were chosen and produced
with specific compositional intentions. Rhythmically merging phrases and
unpredictably overlapping movements to create gradual textural evolutions,
reflecting the rising intensity of the tides, the harmonic refractions of
rippling water.
The Core Library features a
highly versatile collection of original content, with over 200 multi-sampled
core articulations spread across the different families of the orchestra. The
strings are broken down into individual trios of bass, cello and violin. The

Sonic Faction brings
together 8 synthesizers and drum machines already known and unreleased in a
bundle for Kontakt 5 compatible with the NKS format.
The Archetype bundle
therefore includes 8 virtual instruments for Kontakt 5 and the Kontakt Player
5, with automatic parameter mappings to the Komplete Kontrol S keyboards and
the Native Instruments Maschine, thanks to the support of the Native Kontrol
Standard format.
Sonic Faction regulars
will find some well-known instruments in this bundle, such as the Whoosh
Machine, but they will also be able to discover new creations.
With the exception of
Whoosh Machine, all instruments feature an 8x8 step sequencer that lets you
create patterns on the fly, with scale selection, sequence modulation, save and
recall patterns, and more.
Presentation of the
different instruments:
 Beatdown: a drum machine
comprising 40 kits, envelopes and dedicated LFOs, an effects section with a
Granulizer, as well as dedicated audio and MIDI articulations for each cell of
the sequencer.
 Clone: ​​an 80s-inspired synth with three oscillators,
envelopes, LFOs (2 assignable and the possibility of controlling 3 LFOs at
once) and effects, to create arpeggiated bass lines, leads, modulations
 Evilfish 303: a
hyper-sampled version of the 303, with 8 types of waveforms with overdrive, a
303-style filter with the ability to morph and change modes between notch and
formant, an effects section with saturation, distortion, Redux and Nuke, to create
punchy bass lines.
 Hatchet: a monodic
melodic synth capable of generating powerful leads, warm basses, including
oscillators with square and sawtooth waveforms and a detuning option, LFOs and
effects (filters, reverbs, bit crushers).
 Pulsator: a synth with
two digital oscillators capable of creating very aggressive pads, leads and
basses, including an X-Mod oscillator, a detuning option and an effects section
 Rogue-One: a classic
vintage synth with the possibility of detuning the oscillators, an effects
section with reverb, delays, phasers, a Granulizer, to create soundscapes, dark
cinematic sounds, fat analog style sounds , etc.
 Slickness: a synth with
two multi-oscillators that can use hundreds of classic waveforms, formant and
granular wavetables, a Hypersaw, a sub-oscillator, a modulation section with 3
LFOs and a effects section with a Granulizer
 Whoosh Machine: an
effect that allows you to create drones, transitions, atmospheres, etc. mixing
noise, synthesis and textures and managing envelopes, LFOs and the Granulizer

Novachord or the Bowed Piano, and the sound designers Ian Boddy, Andy Wheddon,

snapshots.
So in total, you have 8 GB
of sounds (compressed to 5.55 GB) to use in Kontakt's GUI, and that's where
things get interesting because you also get a vector synthesizer called Cube,
through which you can create complex movements from four waveforms of your
choice, each with its own filters, envelope, pitch and LFO. The movements will
be animated via an XY pad between the four shapes and synchronized to the tempo
of your DAW. This Cube can also be automated.

French musician
Jean-Philippe Rykiel contacted us about a unique type of African balafon in
which each key has "collets" that vibrate when played, giving it an
interesting buzzing quality.
Sometimes called
"gyil" (JEE-le), it is commonly found in parts of northern Ghana,
Burkina Faso and southeastern Mali. Hardwood keys hang above gourds. Silk or
paper cover small holes in the gourds which resonate to produce the
characteristic hum.
Rykiel has a long-standing
interest in West African musicians, having collaborated with the wonderful
Salif Keita and Youssou N'Dour. For the balafon, however, he knew a virtuoso
player from Burkina Faso, Mamadou Diabate, who now lives in Austria. He asked
Mamadou to play the instrument for a recording session that he would conduct
himself.
The recordings have come
down to us, and the result is the instrument you'll find here. We hope you find
this instrument both intriguing and inspiring!"""

The ropes that suit you
This product is the
culmination of all our efforts so far. It combines our experience with
orchestral phrases with what we've learned over the years about multisampling,
and it continues our quest for total phrase flexibility.
At its core, Orchestral
Strings is an extremely capable full-divisi string section, recorded with the
fantastic Capellen Orchestra in Zlin, Czech Republic, and edited with great
care to preserve every performance detail.
We've covered all the most
commonly used articulations, with up to four velocities, and we've designed a
'common tail' system for short strings, which allows you to have more round
robins without increasing the memory load too much.
Poly-Legato and Auto
Divisi guarantee the most realistic sound. We still have a few more surprises
up our sleeves that will improve your user experience and provide you with
tools that are both useful and fun.
The instrument includes
powerful midi engines, with midi import, realtime midi manipulation, note
editor and midi export. The possibilities are almost endless, but very easily
accessible if you just want to scratch the surface.
The Runs Engine allows you
to play chords and trigger runs that adhere to those chords by simply playing a
start key and an end key.

played by troubadours and wandering musicians, spreading to theaters and taverns
and now being used not only in Portugal but also throughout South America.
Cavaquinho
The Cavaquinho is the
mother of a whole family of smaller bowed string instruments. It brought the
ukulele to the world, and still serves as the main vehicle of joy and rhythm in
Latin American songs, especially in Brazil and Venezuela, and plays a very
important role in samba and choro music. It was introduced to Brazil by the
Portuguese and then spread all over the world, becoming a treasure in island
cultures, from Cape Verde to Hawaii.

Rattletines are a unique
set of hand-tuned percussion instruments created by instrument designer and
sound sculptor Bart Hopkin. These one-of-a-kind instruments each produce their
own particular flavor of rattling or buzzing, with each note having its own
warm, resonant flavor. Rattletine includes two rows of blades. The upper blades
strike the "anvils" as they vibrate. The bottom row is clean, for
clearer sound quality. Mahogany blades and hacksaw blades both have tabs with
holes in them and small bits of metal rolled through them. When pinched, the
metal casings vibrate as the tongue vibrates, producing a unique buzzing sound.
Aptly named, Hacksaw Blades uses real hacksaw blades for the tabs.
We've faithfully sampled
the bladed clamps and hard-hitting hands on the bodies of the instruments, with
two stereo mic positions. A wide selection of custom FX presets and much of our
ambient content, crafted from the raw acoustic source, gives you complete
creative freedom.
 5 Master presets and 20

BML Mural Symphonic
Strings features 60 of London's finest instrumentalists.
Recorded in the Lyndhurst
lounge at Air Studios from five microphone stations.
Excellent performance,
sound and ambience.
Mural is available in
several distinct volumes:
The first contains
essential articulations (including real legato samples).
The second adds more
fundamental styles such as trills, effects, and Legato slides.
The additional legato
articulations in volume 2 will not work if you don't already have volume 1.
Both volumes require the

conditions and layout are identical, you can mix and match patches from the
first two volumes: this is explored in Volume 2 as combo patches incorporating
samples from both libraries.
Continuing Spitfire
Audio's tradition, the channel sets were recorded from multiple microphone
positions via an analog tape signal path in Air Studios' Lyndhurst room.
Unlike Spitfire's Albion
series strings (which feature octave and unison sets, Mural's sections have
been recorded in separate, united groups, allowing you to make your own
decisions about orchestration and doubling. 'octave.
The section sizes
correspond to those used in a full symphony orchestra:
 16 first violins, 14
second violins (a completely different set of players),
 12 violins, 10 violins
and eight basses, which represents 60 musicians.
Features :
Wall volume 1
The dozen or so
articulations played by the string sections of Volume 1 cover familiar
territory, but one exception is the 'sul ponticello' style: the thin, icy
timbre has a slightly menacing atmosphere, and played by the basses it takes on
a sort of muted arctic grandeur.
A more conventional sense
of menace is conveyed by tremolos, especially when you start quietly and slowly
increase their volume.
Looping vibration and
non-vibration, vibration and non-vibration ("longs" in Spitfire
parlance) play with and without mutations, and both options are lush and
expansive.
Along the same lines, the
floating "flautando" tone supports the soft tone, which is
particularly attractive in the low register.
This style of play is
difficult to control in real life, and therefore benefits from being sampled
and tamed!
Like all contemporary orchestral
libraries, Mural features dynamic modulated dynamic modeling for its long
notes.
Interval-based legato
sampling is a highlight: "fingered legacy" legume patches, in which
both violin sections produce upbeat and vivacious performances, violin players
warn of wind and strings basses combine strength, elegance and lyricism.
Low :
Tuning the cellos and
basses in octaves gives the classic and instantly recognizable sound of bass
orchestration, very effective for sustains, legatos and spiccatos.
Patches called Time
Machine Short Notes use Kontakt's time-stretching algorithm to artificially
alter the length of spiccatos, pizzicatos, and col legno samples via a
Stretch fader on the GUI.
This would be useful if
you need exaggeratedly short spiccato notes or an ultra-short pizzicato cutoff.
The articulations of the
first Mural bank are:
 Longs nonvib
 Longs vib
 Legato Fingered
 Longs Con Sordino nonvib
 Longs Con Sordino vib
 Longs Harmonics
 Longs Flautando
 Longs Tremolando
 Longs Sul Ponticello
 Spiccato
 Pizz
 Bartok Pizz
 Col Legno
In summary :
Size is a factor in the
orchestral world, and the large sections and spacious sound of Mural Symphonic
Strings' Air Lyndhurst Hall are on par with big-screen film music.
Together, these two
volumes provide a wide variety of very usable performance (including true
legato), the recording quality is fabulous, and the multiple microphone
positions make surround mixing a breeze."""

It is in collaboration
with Samuel Sim that Spitfire has produced this orchestral library intended to
simplify writing and arrangement.
Fruit of his collaboration
with Samuel Sim (famous for the dramatic, uncluttered and profound quality of
his television and film compositions), the English publisher has captured a set
dedicated to the emotionally powerful sonorities for which the artist is well
known, but enjoys also to introduce you to a unique way of interacting with the
instrumentalists involved in this library. British Drama Toolkit is unlike
anything virtual instruments and other high-quality libraries have produced to
date.
Striving to produce
original music is one thing, but trying to be consistently original in a
pressurized world like television or film is another. By brilliantly
illustrating himself in this particularly demanding environment, the talented
composer Samuel Sim has won numerous prizes over the years. While the composer
had already worked with Spitfire Audio for the realization of his homonymous
library "SAMUEL SIM - CHRYSALIS", It is therefore not surprising that
the latter turned once again to Spitfire Audio, in order to create a unique
instrument and suitable for musical creation.
British Dram Toolkit is a
virtual score composition instrument in the truest sense of the word. It will
not only provide you with the most instinctive "connection" possible,
but will be of great help to those who need to find a musical voice in their
composition process. You'll find playing styles that have never been sampled
before, but also bespoke bowing techniques, as well as breathing patterns that
will all converge to create full and dramatic textures. During this time, these
same notes, played at a different intensity, will allow you to move from one
instrument to another within a dynamically evolving ensemble. Composed of a
small section of strings and wind instruments recorded at the very headquarters
of Spitfire Audio in London, British Drama Toolkit will take on its full
meaning, because the alchemy will be total and that, from the first contact.
Sets are mapped across the
full length of the keyboard, and playing styles are velocity-bound (from
whispery textures to bold solos). That said, British Drama Toolkit also unveils
a form of advanced understanding of what music is. This library differentiates
between playing softly and loudly, which is not only related to volume, but
also to the character and emotion of the music.
In short, this library
offers you another approach to composition by providing you with a great
variety of instruments (strings, woodwinds, ensembles, etc.), but also a sound
color that will very easily find a place in your sound arsenal. With nearly
2000 samples for a total weight of 6.35 GB."""

percussionist Frank Ricotti was sampled. The virtual instrument relies on a
library of 10,720 samples. This third installment in composer-producer Hans
Zimmer's percussion library collection, depicts instruments in great detail and
with careful attention to the most delicate layers of nuance. The sampled
sounds are played with various types of sticks and using various techniques.
The performance was picked up by 96 individual microphones at Air Studios in
London. HZ3 features various spatial mixes, some captured up close, others more
ambient that you can easily combine to create effects and changes in depth."""

Spitfire renews its Solo
Strings collection
The bank of solo
instruments is getting a makeover at Spitfire.
Solo Strings was one of
Spitfire's first banks, the publisher has since progressed in its sampling
techniques, so it was time to give this collection of violins, viola, cello and
double bass a new lease of life.
To produce the 2018
edition of Solo Strings, Spitfire recorded international stars who can be heard
in particular on the soundtracks of Hollywood blockbusters: Jack Libeck, Clio
Gould and Thomas Gould on the violin, Max Baillie on the viola, Richard Harwood
on cello and Leon Bosch on double bass. All these beautiful people settled in
the Hall of the Air Studios and the ten articulations (long and short notes,
trills, pizzicato, spiccato, sul ponticello, tremolo, col legno) for each
instrument were captured by microphones tube and ribbon, Neve Montserrat
preamps, Neve 88R console, 2" tapes and Prism 96 kHz converters.
Here you will find various
controls for pickups, dynamics, release, vibrato, expression, as well as the
house Ostinatum.
Solo Strings is designed
to stand out, but also to fit in: this all-new library seamlessly integrates
with Spitfire's orchestral lineups, using the same location, unrivaled signal
chain, pickup positions and range of articulations that make up the DNA of our
high quality orchestral packages.
Individual players in the
acoustic luxury of Air Lyndhurst's room, captured on a rich 2" soundtrack.
We are proud to announce
the inclusion of our brand new, highly intuitive Total Performance for Violin
(Virtuoso) patch, providing you with the most detailed and comprehensive solo
performance for virtuoso violin. Performed by world-renowned virtuoso concert
violinist Jack Liebeck, this performance sample is the most advanced and
powerful we've ever seen. It contains all the techniques you need to create a
realistic solo performance - five different types of true legato: Portamento
Legato, Fingerered Legato, Bowed Legato, Runs and Arpeggios. It also includes:
spiccato, staccato, tremolo, molto vibrato, progressive vibrato and no vibrato.
- all combined together to allow musical phrasing without the need to switch

A Legendary Organ
The organ in London's
Union Chapel was built by Henry "Father" Willis in 1877 specifically
to match the size and acoustics of the building, and is undoubtedly one of the
finest in the world. Henry Willis, considered the foremost organ builder of the
Victorian era, also built the organs for the Royal Albert Hall and St Paul's Cathedral.
The Union Chapel organ remains essentially unchanged. The only significant
changes were the replacement of the 4ft Gemshorn Choir with a 2ft Piccolo in
1909, the provision of an electric blower in the 1920s, and the installation of
a balanced Swell pedal in the 1940s. As an important example from the work of
Father Willis, in 2012-2013, the organ was completely restored by organ
builders Harrison & Harrison based on historical principles. The original
hydraulic (water) blower motors have also been restored to working order by
James Richardson-Jones and are retained as an alternative to electric blowing
(one of the very few left in the world!).
It has three manuals,
Swell, Great Organ, Choir, and a full pedalboard.
Paul and his Spitfire
colleagues waited a long time to select the organ they wanted to sample, and
the timing was perfect with the restoration and collaboration with Union
Chapel. They started the project in 2013 and many hours were spent during the
night recording! This instrument has a lot of character and can go from
extraordinarily smooth and delicate to full of power without ever sounding
slightly synthetic or brittle like some of the newer instruments.
As a bonus, Spitfire's
sound design team has created 10 eDNA presets using raw materials from the
organ, which recently featured in the Paul Feig reboot of Ghostbusters in 2016,
as well as a dev kit allowing the user to create their own unique synths. ,

Strezov Sampling has
opened the sale of the first sound bank of its new Afflatus series dedicated to
classical and cinematic strings.
Afflatus Chapter I Strings
for Kontakt, is not a simple bank of string samples but allows you to create
sets of various sizes and styles ranging from classical orchestral to modern
cinematic and more experimental things.
For this, you benefit from
more than 150 articulations captured with three microphone positions (close,
decca and hall, two positions in the mixed sets), 25 true legato polyphonic bow
movements, an automatic divisi function, random articulations or even a sound
design section in which you can mix different separate elements. Finally, the
bank is NKS compatible.
Inspired by icons from
film and classical music, this collection pushes the boundaries of traditional
sampling methods by introducing groundbreaking features like automatic division
combined with Polyphonic True Legato from the Next Generation Choir series and
a thematic approach to techniques. Capturing Directed Musical Samples as
opposed to Generic Static Afflatus Samples Chapter I features several
custom-made articulation groups capable of representing a specific style per
group with ease. This approach offers the user highly specialized and inspiring
virtual instruments capable of performing music with virtuosity: Gone are the
days of soulless samples.
The styles/moods featured
in Afflatus Chapter I range from classic film scores to modern contemporary
film scores. Among the masters who inspired the development of this collection
are Henry Mancini, Sergei Prokofiev, Bernard Herrmann, John Williams and Arvo
Pärt. Here is a never-before-seen demonstration of the Love Scene section
illustrating the thematic approach combined with Polyphonic True Legato.
Overview :

This bank allows you to
use 3 banks in one, these are the Arva, Freya and Wotan banks:
 Wotan: The virtual choir
for Kontakt is composed of 10 tenors and 10 basses, recorded separately in
Sofia Session Studio with three microphone positions (Close, Decca and Hall).
Strezov Sampling recorded 8 syllables with 3 layers of dynamics and 2 round
robins for staccato samples (sustained samples are also available), screams and
whispers with multiple round robins for each syllable and as a bonus you get
three types of recorded clusters for tenors and basses with 3 layers of
dynamics. To manage the syllables, a Syllabuilder has been integrated, with
Connect and Morph modes so that you can create your phrases/sung parts within
Kontakt. You can also save and load your creations as presets, a manager is
included for these.
 Freyja is therefore the
female counterpart of Wotan. This new sample bank for the full version of
Kontakt 5 compiles the recordings of ten professional alto singers and as many
sopranos at Sofia Session Studio.
Freyja Female Choir
includes an all-new Agile Legato sampling technique that combines legato
sampling with an in-house Syllabuilding approach so you can make every syllable
in the bank sing with polyphonic legato. In addition, this intelligent system
allows you to write polyphonic parts within a single patch. In use, you play a
chord with the left hand, a melody with the right hand on your master keyboard
and the two parts will be connected with legato transitions, which are managed
by most controllers, in particular MIDI CC or a pedal of sustain.
Freyja also includes
polyphonic true legato patches for altos and sopranos with different velocities.
 Arva: Arva completes the
Next Generation Choir series launched three years ago. This new bank for the
full version of Kontakt 5 samples two separate sections of girls and boys with
the possibility of taking advantage of divisi. Àrva has an Agile Legato feature
that not only allows you to play each of the 10 available syllables in legato,
but also to benefit from polyphonic writing within the same patch thanks to its
intelligent Voice Leading function. In use, play a chord with the left hand, a
melody with the right hand and the system compatible with most MIDI CC
controllers (including the sustain pedal) takes care of creating the legato
transitions.
Àrva also allows you to
mix the three positions of Close, Decca and Hall microphones and to dose the
house convolution reverb.
Like Wotan and Freya,
which you can combine with this new bank to create a full and massive choir,
Àrva includes polyphonic true legato patches (Ah, Mm, Ooh, Mm-Ah, Mm-Ooh, Mm-
Ooh-Ah) for each divisi, as well as the latest version 3 of the SyllaBuilder to
build vocal phrases in a few clicks and control sample attack, release, volume
and offset. This new version brings compatibility between all the choir banks
of the Next Generation Choir series, so you can share presets and lyrics when
building your virtual choir"""

Here is The Felt Seiler
Pro, an acoustic piano soundbank offered by Strezov Sampling. Recorded in
Studio B of Sofia Session Studios, this sound bank contains samples of piano,
synths and sound textures. Several microphone positions are available and you
can adjust the levels, panning, and stereo width, among other things. Finally,
various effect modules are at your disposal: filters, a compressor, an
equalizer, a delay and a convolution reverb.
The Felt Seiler contains 3
more synthesizer/sound design layers for you to choose from, which will help
you shape your unique sound. We've named these three layers according to the
mood that most closely matches their sound: Warmth, Ache, and Loneliness. For
each of these three layers, you have the option to Purge (the ON/OFF button
above the volume slider), Solo or Mute each of the layers.
Additionally, you can
adjust volume and stereo width, and designate different outputs for each
microphone position if needed. We've also added a "reverse" option
(the circular button depicting an inverted "play" symbol), which
allows you to play any sound design layer backwards, adding even more options
to create different musical textures and colors.
In the center of the GUI,
you will find the "Soft" and "Sustain" buttons. The
"Sustain" button is by default linked to your piano's sustain pedal,
as you might expect, and when pressed the sustain samples are played. However,
clicking the button in the GUI will allow all available sustain samples to
play. We also sampled the Felt Seiler with the Soft pedal pressed and this mode
can be activated by clicking on the "Soft" button on the interface.
This sound is quieter, even softer, because the piano dampers are closer to the
strings, there is less vibration, resulting in that warmer, more delicate piano
sound."""

Introducing Bass Pedals -
An endless source of wall-breaking subs, dirty bass drones, and obese analog
sounds!
Bass Pedals for Kontakt 4
(and later) are powered by over 3200 meticulously recorded multi-sampled
sounds, driven by a custom Kontakt 4 engine and intuitive GUI.
Inspired by the highly
sought after Moog Taurus Mk1 Bass Synthesizer, the Bass Pedals combine powerful
analog source sounds with modern tone shaping capabilities to create a
versatile, fully programmable bass synthesizer!
Bass Pedals for Kontakt
offers four main editing pages:
Preset Page
The preset page is capable
of loading 28 extensively multi-sampled patches designed and recorded from a
vintage Moog Taurus MK1 bass synthesizer. All preset patches offer 3
turn-by-turn sound variations and long samples to help capture the
imperfections of the original instrument. The sounds on this page can be edited
and mixed with Bass Pedals' "raw oscillators" to create interesting
"hybrid" patches.
Raw Oscillator Page
(Synthesizer)
Synthesize your own
"Taurus-like" sounds using the raw oscillators of the bass pedals...
The raw mode has 2 analog oscillators (each with switchable overdriven
waveforms thanks to an Empirical Labs Fatso), 1 switchable sub-oscillator,
noise source and oscillator unison modes, all of which are individually fed by
a comprehensive set of carefully looped waveforms recorded from a Taurus MK1
analog bass synthesizer
Effects Page
The effects page features
a number of fully editable effects as well as specially created IR reverbs
(impulse responses) recorded from our Eventide DSP-7000 harmonizer.
Controls page
The controls page lets you
control the mono mode of instruments with selectable note priorities,
portamento, pitch bend range, keyboard velocity, and curve response. It is
important to note that just like the original Moog Taurus; Bass Pedals was
designed to be a monophonic instrument. A custom Kontakt script is used to
realistically "cut" previous notes once a new key is played, even
when using Amp Screenshot settings.
Included with the
instrument:
 4.5 GB master sound
library featuring 3,207 multi-sampled 24-bit WAV samples
 Heavily scripted custom
Kontakt 4+ instrument and intuitive GUI (requires Kontakt full version)
 28 heavily multi-sampled
Taurus MK1 patches (including 3 x round robin)
 40 carefully programmed
bass pedal presets and starting points using the instrument's Raw Oscillator
