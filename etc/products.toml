The 1990 Studio Grand Piano is amongst one of our favorite virtual instruments ever done. This extraordinary library contains over 48.000 samples and unique microphones/positions, including Neumann 87’s, Coles, Neve SE Ribbon’s, AKG 414’s and Neumann KM 184’s. Everything was lovingly recorded & processed at a famous hi-tech British Studio through one of the greatest custom NEVE desks in existence. \r\r
\r\r
We wanted to create a hyper-realistic virtual instrument that pays an homage to its counter-part in reality – the incredibly versatile and studio defacto, Yamaha C7. The piano is best described as incredibly versatile and fantastic for pop, rock, classical, fusion and all in-between. The sustain samples were carefully crafted at both pedal up and pedal down positions. We also have bonus sampled staccato and staccatissimo notes (w/round robin each), so you have the correct attack for faster runs. In addition, the library gives you full control over the dynamic response as well as mechanics and tone, so you can dial in the perfect sound & dynamic match for your workflow – all simply done with a click of the mouse. We also included full control over resonance, room tone and signal chain noise, non-tonal key control, unique release triggers for hammer action, string damping, and release triggers for our room and ambient microphones. In essence you have everything right at your fingertips and most importantly – it just works effortlessly."""

Starting with the Violins, this newly reworked volume brings you the latest improvements in programming and workflow previously found only in our critically acclaimed Century Series. The update includes the familiar and easy to use Century interface, remastered articulations, a powerful articulation matrix, integrated mixing capabilities, and for advanced real-time processing, our Chaos Effects.\r\r
\r\r
With the new advanced Articulation browser, you can create your very own matrix of custom playing styles to suit your compositional needs. You can easily balance each articulation and assign each style its own dedicated Key-switch or Midi CC. Whether you are building a template and need to separate the long and short articulations; building performance-based patches out of the dozens of playing styles; or creating a custom set of patches needed for your specific arrangement, Adagio gives you the power to shape this iconic sound to your workflow.\r\r
\r\r
Say goodbye to Multis. With the update to Adagio, you will find various remastered layered Legato articulations made from 11 independent styles of lyrical Legato.\r\r
\r\r
These Legatos have been completely reworked and redesigned to make expressive string writing completely effortless. The new legatos now adapt to the way you play, a softer velocity will trigger a more passionate set of Legato transitions, whereas playing more intensely triggers Legatos with a stronger transition.\r\r
\r\r
The Adagio series was recorded in a beautiful church environment and contains three main groups of master violinists: Full Ensemble Violins (11 Players), Small Ensemble or Chamber Violins (3 Players) and a Solo Virtuoso Violinist (1 Player). Each section was sampled to capture the raw emotions and true expression within each string ensemble. Every articulation has been extensively sampled, including a total of 11 individual legato techniques, each with up to three times round robin, and a wealth of dynamic short notes including multiple styles of Spiccato. Each articulation is sampled with movement and character; the natural expression in each sample makes for a truly authentic playing experience that will be instantly noticeable in your next production."""

8Dio Aura Guitars is the ultimate collection of deep-sampled motion picture guitars.  Aura Guitars contains 12 different guitars, including Martin, 12 String, Dobro, Mandolin, Ukulele, 8 String Schecter, Silent Guitar, Stratocaster, Telecaster, Les Paul and assortment of Bass Guitars. It contains both multi-sampled single notes and multi-sampled chords. All the chords were sampled in perfect fifth, so you can essentially generate any chord and rhythm you want. All 12 guitars were sampled symmetrically – meaning that you can freely blend anything you want and it will work together. So you literally have billions of patch combinations.\r\r
\r\r
Aura Guitars contains 3 modules, so you can freely mix and blend up to three different guitars together. The collection spans over 9GB of content (lossless compressed from 17GB) and several thousand auras. Aura Guitars also contains an advanced grid-sequencer, which allows you to completely create your own signature rhythms by using velocity, pan, pitch and on/off functions for each step in the Aura. All the guitars were also multi-sampled, so when you play chords you can freely mix between muted/non-tonal strums and glide into rich, open chords by using the modwheel. In addition we also multi-sampled the single notes, so you can create more realistic sounding guitar rhythms.\r\r
\r\r
Aura Guitars is designed for instant gratification. It is insanely easy to use and get inspired – and it also allows you to go incredibly deep and even into the realm of chaos. We created chaos features both both patches, grid-sequencing and FX. So with one click the library can generate a completely new patch – with one click it can generate a completely new grid-sequence and with one click it can randomize all the FX. In essence you have an infinite amount of combinations and it just makes the library a true inspiration to work with."""

The majority of instruments in Aura Tonal Exotic Studio Percussion were also recorded with two different types of mallets, sticks and brushes.

\r\r
Aura Tonal Exotic Studio Percussion contains 3 microphone positions (Close, Mid, Room) that each have a very distinct sound. We’ve also included a new dual layered FX system. The first part is our front-face FX system that gives you control over dynamics, filters, pitch and micro-pitch, delay, bit-resolution and our new textural convolution delay. The new textural delay allows you to take and use them as delay components, so the instrument will delay other sounds than just itself. We’ve also included our new Chaos FX engine, which gives you a large control over things such as EQ, Distortion, Stereo-Delay and an additional convolution reverb.\r\r

It has always been our mantra to push sampling forward in regards to realism and playability. Aura Studio Exotic Percussion is the first of several to utilize our proprietary Groove Sampling™ method and we really think it is going to make compositions richer and easier to create."""

The heart of Insolidus is 40 males and 25 females hand-picked by master conductor Petr Polonanik. The same ensemble is featured in the follow-up library, Silka \r\r
\r\r
A variety of new recording and sampling techniques were used in Insolidus, making it the most realistic, instantly playable, and lyrical symphonic choir in existence. Our new Syllable arcs offer a naturally swelling motion of the choir, and the ability to control the number of syllables (2, 3, or 4) you want in the arc. Insolidus contains an advanced phrase-builder offering you the ability to create up to 64 strings of syllables. Along with short notes and sustains, it includes a deep assortment of new multi-vowels that were sampled dynamically, with different rhythmic accentuation. You have velocity based True Legato for Ah, Eh, Oh, and Uh."""

Intimate Studio Woodwinds is the latest creation in our series of contemporary studio ensembles. With over 160 hours of session material recorded at Scotland’s Premiere Recording Studio, Gorbals Sound, Intimate Studio Woodwinds continues our concept of a completely modular ensemble. The library features five highly expressive solo woodwind players, a Flute, Oboe, Cor Anglais, Clarinet, and Bass Clarinet. Each player was recorded in isolation, but all at the same time, so you can fluidly switch between any instrument and any articulation without compromising the sound or timing of your music. \r\r
\r\r
The sound of the ensemble is easily customizable with the wealth of options in the advanced user-interface. Each instrument also allows for extreme control over the stereo image with individual volume, panning, output routing, and the new distance control, which enables you to freely blend between a direct signal and a more spacious and ambient microphone position. \r\r
\r\r
Intimate Studio Woodwinds contains a vast collection of 26 articulations covering everything you need to create authentic-sounding woodwind melodies. Each articulation is sorted into four main categories (Traditional, Arcs, Performance, and Effects), making them all quickly and easily accessible from the built-in browser. The advanced user interface allows you to load and unload the articulations of your choosing, so you only have to load the sounds you need for your project. The Legatos are incredibly agile and can play almost anything you throw at them."""

The Aurora Choir is an elegant and powerful choir sample library for Kontakt, and represents somewhat of a milestone for Aria Sounds, being the culmination of many hours of work, study and tweaking.\r\r

The library contains both Sopranos and Altos (separate instruments for maximum control), and has an absolutely stunning legato tone. On top of this, it has short syllables, arranged into a very conveniently playable sequencer. Simple arrange your phrase in the sequence, and play away - the choir will automatically sing the syllables you enter.\r\r

Multiple Legato Modes at Multiple Dynamics\r\r
\r\r
The choir contains four true legato modes (ah, eh, ih and oh) sampled at multiple dynamic layers, giving a total of EIGHT true sampled legato sets, for absolute realism and variation. On top of this, there are a total of twenty four different syllable shorts, sequence-able in the GUI, each sampled at three dynamic layers, giving a total of 72 variations per short note!"""

As there is a smooth gradient from bottom to top in terms of dynamic layers (see curve below), dragging the entire velocity data of the track up and down will completely transform the performance, as opposed to just moving the MIDI data through a few dynamic layers, and primarily relying on simply lowering and raising the volume of certain samples.

After much recording, production, tireless testing, re-testing and finally refining the end result, we are very happy to bring you the complete Master Solo Woodwinds bundle, which contains meticulously sampled solo flute, piccolo, oboe, clarinet and bassoon sampled Kontakt instruments (will work in Kontakt 4 and all higher versions - but not the free Kontakt "player").\r\r
\r\r
True Legato\r\r
\r\r
Multiple sets of true legato intervals were recorded both with and without vibrato, for the ultimate in realistic sounding performance.\r\r
\r\r
Trills/Tremolos\r\r
\r\r
Select this articulation, and you can play a trill or tremolo between any two notes by holding them down on the keyboard (up to seven notes apart/a perfect fifth). See the video demo below for a demonstration of this.\r\r
\r\r
Key Noises\r\r
\r\r
These woodwind instruments owe part of the character of their sound to the mechanics of the instrument, so we decided to come up with something that allows some form of control over this subtle characteristic in timbre. What we ended up with was a knob that can control the level of mechanical noise that is audible from the instrument. You can turn this up, or off completely in the GUI to set the average level that seems right, and it will then, on top of this, react to the velocity of your own playing, much like it would a real player pressing harder or softer.\r\r
\r\r
Please note, as vibrato on the Clarinet is not a standard technique, we have not included it, but the other four instruments all include vibrato legato as WELL as non vibrato legato and sustains, all at multiple crossfade-able dynamic layers (MIDI CC1/Mod Wheel).\r\r
You are even able to control the level/volume of the key sounds/mechanics of the instruments, and the sound of the flautist pressing the keys will also be louder depending on how hard you press the key on your MIDI keyboard (velocity).\r\r
\r\r
One feature we are exceptionally proud of is the intuitive trills articulation system, which allows you to play any trill/tremolo within the flute's playable range up to a perfect fifth (seven chromatic notes)... See the demo video for an insight in to how this works!\r\r

With an instrument as diverse, capable, and exposed as the violin, there is no cutting corners, so we strived to capture as much of the possible sounds a violin can make as possible, resulting in the huge list of articulations you can see below, as well as four sampled legato styles, also shown below. We even specially sampled slurred and bowed legato so you can correctly and realistically phrase passages, and a specially sampled "fast legato" set of intervals, which will allow you to play virtuosic runs and scale passages.\r\r
\r\r
On top of this, we want our instruments to be as close in sonic-flexibility to a real situation as they can be, so in addition to providing close and stage mic positions, we have also made sure to have both a ribbon and condenser mic, which you can choose to switch between. Both sounds offer so much in their own right, the ribbon having a beautiful smooth tone, and the condenser being ruthless in exposing every little detail in the sound.\r\r
\r\r
The stereo mic position can be widened and narrowed by dragging the mics in the interface.\r\r
\r\r
We wanted to make this instrument even more musical, so we have once again used our idea of the "phrase builder", which allows you to select the attack, or beginning sound of a phrase, and then switch around the type of legato throughout a musical phrase.\r\r
\r\r
One huge give-away that an instrument is a sampled one and not a real instrument is how the beginning of every musical phrase sounds the same. A great performer will not sound like this. They will vary the phrase beginnings, and perhaps start some quietly, some with an FP, some with a stutter, and so we have included five options for this, to ensure that your compositions sound evolving, musical, and extremely convincing.\r\r
\r\r
The width of the stereo mic perspective can be changed by dragging the bottom pair of microphones in the interface, and dynamics can be brought up and down by either the mod wheel or expression Midi CC - depending on whether you have MOD or EXP selected in the bottom right hand corner of the instrument GUI, and the shorts' dynamics are controlled by velocity.\r\r
\r\r
Four True-sampled Legato Styles\r\r
\r\r
We spent a while tackling how to approach allowing the user to play both slow more drawn out passages, and then also being able to create realistic renditions of more virtuosic, fast passages, and eventually came up with a very intricate technique which allows both.\r\r
\r\r
We sampled these intervals completely differently, and set it up so you can switch between these depending on whether you are playing fast or not. So for the faster legato, you can switch to "fast" with the legato keyswitching, and play intervals up to and including a minor third in your scales and runs, maintaining a very realistic sound. The sound of the note transitions on a violin when playing fast is completely different from the sound when playing slower, and both are captured and skilfully programmed into this instrument.\r\r
\r\r
Types of Legato\r\r
\r\r
* Slurred Legato - switching note with the finger only, without changing bow direction... the smoothest legato sound.\r\r
* Bowed Legato - changing the bow at the note change. A more noticeable interval. (slurred and bowed legato are both essential in obtaining a realistic and well phrased performance)\r\r
* Portamento Legato - a subtle slide between notes.\r\r
* Fast Legato - Specially sampled intervals which allow you to play fast runs/scales with intervals up to a minor third between each note - something seriously lacking and rarely possible with most sample libraries.\r\r
\r\r
ARTICULATION LIST\r\r
\r\r
* Normal Sustain\r\r
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)\r\r
* Crescendo\r\r

We are proud to present Octohorn, the first release from our brass series, with an eight-player French Horn ensemble, boasting no less then seven mic positions, with the aims of giving you absolute and ultimate control over your soundscape.\r\r
\r\r
This instrument was created with the intentions of producing something in a completely new league of sonic sculpt-ability, able to sit in a track with the depth and spread of a real ensemble recording. We have achieved this through multiple new and innovative features, including the seven mic positions, carefully set to cover the whole soundscape, recorded chords and octaves to minimize "sample layering" in tracks, which kills the depth of a track, and much more...\r\r
\r\r
Mix between the perspectives; Decca tree sides and mid, flanks, room, woodwind spots (see more about this below!), close ribbons and close LDCs, with the flexibility aimed at replicating a real scoring session. Now you have control over the different mic and perspective levels in the session, enabling you to morph your own sound in your scores, as if you were at the studio with the console at your fingertips.\r\r
\r\r
You might have noticed that one of the perspectives included is "woodwind spots". While this is not a woodwind library, the mics that spot the woodwinds were set up and included in the recording. The reason for this, is that a lot of the brass sound bleeds heavily into the woodwind mics in scoring sessions, adding to the perceived depth of the sound, so whilst pushing to achieve the most versatile, we felt that this absolutely had to be included.\r\r
\r\r
Three True-sampled Legato Styles\r\r
\r\r
The instrument comes with three true legato modes - a normal slurred legato, a sample octave legato, and a fast legato, for faster passages,which will allow you to play virtuoso runs and scale passages.\r\r
\r\r
The reason we included octave sustains and legato, is because when you play octaves by layering the same instrument twice, what you are hearing is no longer a real octave passage, but two sets of the exact same horns, in the exact same position, layered on top of one another. When an ensemble plays real octave, every note has it's own sonic space and position in hall, and therefore in the perceived depth/stereo field, and you lose this by layering samples. For this reason, we recorded octave sustains and legato specially for a completely true and real sound. \r\r
\r\r
Not only did we just record the octaves, we recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... again for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples. With this instrument, you can achieve that real spacious sound.\r\r
\r\r
Full list of articulations:\r\r
\r\r
* No Legato (allows polyphonic playing)\r\r
* Legato - normal slurred legato (piano and forte dynamic layers crossfade-able)\r\r
* Oct Legato - True octave legato\r\r
* Fst Legato - Fast legato specially for fast playing\r\r
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)\r\r
* Chords < - Crescendo major, minor and open 5th chords\r\r
* Chords > - Diminuendo major, minor and open 5th chords\r\r
* Staccato - Short notes, with up to 5RR per dynamic layer (three layers)\r\r

Music composition and production is constantly evolving, and the tools used to create music need to evolve along with this. The concept for this library involved capturing colours from a string orchestra which have not yet been recorded for any sample library, and place them at your fingertips, ready to compose and perform with.\r\r
\r\r
Angel Strings Vol.1 Includes textural elements, morphing into/out from atonality, risers/divebombs ideal for building tension (for example in trailer music), different styles of spiccato/staccato, marcato to soft attacks with sustains, fast tempo-locked tremolo for powerful driving string hooks and more...\r\r
\r\r
The techniques and articulations available in Angel Strings Vol.1 were cleverly recorded with the entire string orchestra in the same room all at once, in a way that seamlessly blends from the bottom of the range (double basses) to the highest violin notes. You can play the entire orchestra with each articulation across a single keyboard with a single NKI, making this library perfect for anything from merely sketching your ideas out on a full keyboard range - to easily executing unique parts for your final compositions.\r\r
\r\r
THE STUDIOANGEL STUDIOS\r\r
This library was recorded at Angel Studios in London, where countless pop/rock stars have recorded (notably Adele's "21"), and many major film and video game scores have been recorded, including The Lion King, Jackie, Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Horizon: Zero Dawn and many more...\r\r
\r\r
Angel Strings Vol.1 is another collaboration between Auddict and the fantastic "United Strings of Europe", a London-based ensemble made up of young professionals from across the European Union and Switzerland with the goal of promoting musical and cultural cooperation at the highest level.\r\r
\r\r
The ensemble is gaining recognition for its exciting performances in Switzerland, France, Lebanon and the UK. With several world premieres of works by Hristic, Marinkovic and Winkler, the ensemble has collaborated with a number of distinguished artists including Hildegarde Fesneau, Marc Benzekri, Mateja Marinkovic, Jack Liebeck, Walter Delahunt and Ljubisa Jovanovic.\r\r

You can transform the hard-hitting drummer trio we used during the sessions (which gave the library its name) into an army of players, ready to crush anything standing in their way.

The three headed monster.\r\r
\r\r
Cerberus is all about tight and punchy drums, covering from Gran Cassas, Kicks, Toms and Snares to Clacks and Clicks. We recorded a trio of players, each one playing two drums at the same time, giving you a total of 6 simultaneous sounding drums. This results in a larger-than-life sound without losing any tightness.\r\r
\r\r
You need more players?, here’s an army for you.\r\r
\r\r
Because bigger is better than big, Cerberus offers a state-of-the-art functionality for stacking drums. We recorded the triple amount of round robins, so you could stack up to 3 different layers. That gives you 18 simultaneous sounding drums! You can even add timing/pan variation to each hit to make it sound looser/broader.\r\r
\r\r
Droom Loops.\r\r
\r\r
Cerberus comes loaded with a large set of tempo synced drum loops, all created from the original source material. The loops come in 120bpm, 90bpm, 4/4, and 3/4 variations. Each loop additionally has the low, mid, and high stems laid out on the keyboard, allowing you to layer stems to create your own combinations. For a TV or library composer who writes lots of underscore, these loops are going to be incredible time savers.\r\r

Two top-quality hybrid pianos in one instrument, for the ultimate in depth and versatility. Gravitas morphs between an orchestral grand and a synthetic piano engineered by top sound designers, while Red Planet layers in electric guitar for out-of-this-world tones.\r\r
\r\r
Lush, spacious, and rich in tone, Klavier is a versatile, top-quality hybrid and underscore piano instrument that is incredibly easy to use. At the core of Klavier, we have two instruments: The first, our Gravitas Piano, allows you to morph between a deeply sampled orchestral grand piano, and synthetic piano sound design created by some of the top trailer composers and sound designers out there. The second, our Red Planet Piano, allows you to morph between our deeply sampled orchestral grand and electric guitar sound design layers. With this wide range of sonic possibilities, Klavier serves as an incredibly useful instrument for a wide range of music.\r\r
\r\r
Gravitas Piano (Piano meets Sound Design).\r\r
\r\r
AUDIO IMPERIA's “Klavier" is the first instrument in our new “Private Stock Instruments” series. Originally intended as a private sample library for a group of trailer composers, the two instruments in this series combine the very best of the worlds of raw/organic recordings and post-production/sound design. The goal throughout the whole project was to start with the user experience and the raw sound and to work our way backwards to a final product that is both versatile and instantly inspiring.\r\r
The Gravitas Piano was designed specifically for trailer music. A piano that can cut through in a big and epic mix, yet still retain a lot of warmth and depth. To achieve this, we used a set of six stereo microphones and then combined these with their corresponding sound-designed (“Synthetic”) counterparts in post production.\r\r
\r\r
Organic Piano: Yamaha Baby Grand Piano\r\r
\r\r
* 2x Brauner Phantom Classic Front End Audio Microphones (above the piano)\r\r
* 2x DPA 4011A Cardioid Microphones (below the piano)\r\r
* 2x Neumann KM184 Small-diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphones (above the keys, one on each side of the player)\r\r
* 2x Neumann U87 Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphones (inside the lid)\r\r
* 2x Coles 4038 Ribbon Microphones (inside the lid)\r\r
* 2x Earthworks QTC40 Small-diaphragm Omnidirectional Condenser Microphones (room)\r\r
\r\r
The Gravitas Piano comes with 35 “Synthetic” presets, made by some of the best producers in the trailer industry. These “Synthetic” presets can be accessed via the preset control on the “Synthetic” side of the piano. The “Organic” piano offers both Sustained and Staccato articulations. All of the “Synthetic” presets were made using the original samples from the “Organic” piano. No synthesizers or other instruments were used, just pure sound manipulation and sound design.\r\r

\r\r
Red Planet Piano (Piano meets Electric Guitar).\r\r
\r\r
The “Red Planet Piano” was heavily inspired by the movie adaptation of Andy Weir’s “The Martian”. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is absolutely amazing and inspired us to create an “outer space” version of the Klavier. \r\r
The Red Planet Piano shares the same organic sample pool used for the Gravitas Piano. But to get that particular “outer space” electric guitar sound, we created a number of complex guitar sounds. They are designed to match that lush and wide sound that you need to evoke that feeling of depth and space. This, combined with the organic piano, creates a truly unique sound.\r\r
We used a blend of the neck (humbucker) and the split-coil (single coil) position of the very limited Ibanez JPM90HAM. A perfect blend of the single coil twang and directness and the warmth and depth of the neck humbucker. The initial recordings were done direct and we then reamped the recordings through various amp and fx signal chains."""

Introducing Pyramid. Our unified Kontakt scripting framework. Countless hours were spent on bringing one of the easiest user experiences in the industry. No learning curves for each product, once you know Pyramid, you know them all.\r\r
\r\r
Zero knowledge required.\r\r
\r\r
There's a bunch of electric guitar libraries in the market, but most of them require at least some basic knowledge on how to play the real deal. Frets, finger positions, yuck. We hated that. With Trailer Guitars 2 you get that instant satisfaction of getting the sound you're craving for with zero effort and zero knowledge. It can go from clean and angelic to distorted and hellish in a second.\r\r
\r\r
Multisampled, multitracked.\r\r
\r\r
The big player of Trailer Guitars 2 is the Multisamples. We recorded 13 different articulations in mono, twice. This allows you to pan each one of the recording sets to L and R independently. The result: A breathtaking stereo sound out of the box. You can even control both of the channels volume and pan independently.\r\r
\r\r
The simplest of loops.\r\r
\r\r
We recorded a huge set of "simple loops". These are basic and generic sequences that are very commonly played on backing electric guitars, which are specially useful for adding some organic movement to your tracks.\r\r

Oceanway Studio A in quickly becoming one of the World’s premier recording venues for orchestral music. Built inside of a 100 year old church, the acoustic is large yet controlled. There’s a signature depth in this room which makes it ideal for film score and TV based productions. \r\r
\r\r
Mics\r\r
\r\r
Scoring Synths was recorded with a series of priceless microphones, including a set of M50’s used by Shawn Murphy to record E.T. With a standard orchestral setup, we captured close, mid room, decca tree, wide, surround and rear surround perspectives in addition to the DI signal. \r\r
\r\r
A new addition to the modern orchestra.\r\r
\r\r
With 8 available mic perspectives, Scoring Synths offers a sonic depth that can’t be found in any other synth instrument. Recording synths in a real room acoustic adds an organic character and 3D depth that can’t be replicated with a reverb unit."""

Pattern Strings offers a unique approach to ostinatos by providing a collection of tempo-synced rhythmic fragments.\r\r
These 19 rhythms have been recorded at two dynamic layers on violin, viola, cello, and bass, with 4 round robins.\r\r
The interface utilizes an intuitive drag and drop mechanic which allows you to arrange the rhythms into sequences in which all the rhythms flow together with natural phrasing and musicality.\r\r
\r\r
You can Drag and Drop rhythms in the center to either of the pattern strips. If you want to change the order of the rhythms you can do that too, by dragging them around.\r\r
\r\r
With Legato turned on, new notes start sync-ed with previous held notes. This way it's possible to create convincing lines by changing notes according to the rhythms, as seen in the demos.\r\r
\r\r
Pattern Strings has an Automatic Bow Direction feature. It plays downbow samples on downbeats and upbow samples on upbeats, which creates a natural ebb and flow between beats.\r\r
\r\r
The Tempo Sync switch allows you to set the sample playback to half speed or double speed.\r\r
Some of the samples were recorded at 90bpm, and others at 80bpm. So, let's say you're working at 160bpm. This would mean that the 90bpm samples would be time stretched to twice their original speed! To make up for this, you could use the Tempo Sync option to set the speed to be half as fast.\r\r
\r\r
All the combinations of instruments have been rendered down, both single and with stereo doubling. This makes it possible to layer instruments together without so much memory and cpu.\r\r
\r\r
Because Pattern Strings contains 8.32GB of samples, the interface was designed with a Dynamic Loading system so that it only loads what you need. In order to make it more efficient, combinations of instruments have been rendered together, saving on voice count and memory. This way if all instruments are enabled, it will use the same amount of memory and CPU as if only one instrument was enabled.\r\r
\r\r
Beef up the sound of an instrument by turning on Doubling. Stereo-doubled samples have been rendered down, so turning this on won't increase the number of voices or memory needed.\r\r
\r\r
Say you're using Pattern Strings on a track, and you have a couple of different variations you want to use at different parts of the track. Rather than opening up multiple instances, you could save variations into Custom Keyswitches.\r\r
Just click “Map”, then click on one of the colored keys at the very bottom of the keyboard, and Voilà, the current pattern can now be recalled by that key!\r\r
\r\r
Generate a sequence of rhythms using the Random Button, and perhaps you will find something useful."""

Sospiro Strings is a Kontakt library for creating slow, emotive strings. It features 4 different length swells and 3 sustained articulations, recorded on bass, cello, viola, and violin.\r\r
\r\r
There are separate nki's for each individual instrument, and there is an nki with all instruments mixed together, to work as a simpler sketching tool, and also to save memory.\r\r
There are 2 varieties of Swells:\r\r
\r\r
* The vibrato swells are provide a warm, individual sound. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option. All of the swells were originally recorded at 110 BPM\r\r
* The non-vibrato swells have a clear tone which especially brings attention to the change in tone as each instrument louder and softer.\r\r
Each version, Vibrato and non-vibrato has a single velocity layer. \r\r
\r\r
Using the Length in Beats slider, you can choose the appropriate length, and the corresponding swell will be chosen and time-stretched if needed.\r\r
The Length Multiplier is useful if you have a project with a fast bpm and you want it to sound slow, or vice versa.\r\r
The Smart Release feature makes it so that however far into the crescendo-ing part of the sample you have held the note, it will jump that far from the end of the swell. This means that the longer you hold a note, the longer its release will be.\r\r
All of the swells can be either vibrato or non-vibrato. The vibrato adds warmth and individuality to the sound, but may be a bit over dramatic in some cases. The non-vibrato has a lot of clarity, and especially brings attention to change in tone as each instrument gets louder and softer. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option.\r\r
The Sync feature is one of the most essential features: with Sync enabled, any notes you add or change in a chord will sync with the first note that was played.\r\r
There are 3 varieties of Sustains:\r\r
\r\r
* The cold sustains are played with a slow bow and no vibrato --a fragile sound at the edge of breaking.\r\r
* The warm sustains are played over the fingerboard with a fast, freely changing bow and generous vibrato.\r\r
* The full sustains are played closer to the bridge with a slow, heavy bow. Vibrato is used with discretion.\r\r
\r\r
There is an option to double the sound, which layers two instances together and pans them slightly apart. This sounds better if you are only using one instrument by itself and only playing a few notes at a time. If you are playing big chords and layering all 4 instruments together, the doubled feature tends to sound more generic and uninteresting."""

String Flow Cello samples a technique string players use, in which they quickly roll the bow across the strings to create an energetic, chordal texture.\r\r
There are 2 ways to play the instrument.\r\r
The first way is simple: just choose what type of chord you want, what key to be in, and then play on the white keys. Whatever you play will pick a harmony which will fit into whatever key you've chosen. It's kind of like the "Harmonize" factory scripts in Kontakt, except that in this case, all of the harmonies had to be manually recorded!\r\r
The second way to play requires more knowledge of the instrument, and is more flexible. If you play a chord that has been recorded, the instrument will play that chord on viola.\r\r
The midi clips which come with the instrument demonstrate which chords work.\r\r
\r\r
* The interface reacts to notes played, displaying what the music notation would look like to the player, and also showing which voicing, inversion, and key the chord is in. This could be an educational for those looking to write music for live musicians.\r\r
* Comes with a collection of midi clips to introduce the instrument. These include a collection of short progressions, and examples of all the possible voicings.\r\r
* Each chord was played for 4 measures (about 9 seconds). Loops are enabled for all samples.\r\r
* Automatically tempo-syncs to project tempo. The samples were recorded at 100BPM. 85 - 160BPM sounds good, and the optimal tempo is 120BPM.\r\r
* Chords are organized into 4 different types of voicings. Closed spacing, open spacing, 7th chords, and open 5ths.\r\r
* The closed spacing chords were recorded in both major and minor, and in all 3 inversions. The 7th chords include a dominant 7th, minor 7th, and major 7th voicing.\r\r
* Except for the open 5ths voicings, each chord recorded at 2 velocity layers, and each velocity layer has a normale version and a ponticello version, which can be crossfaded between using the modwheel. This is a good way to add motion to the sound.\r\r
* The louder velocity layer has rubato which adds contrast, and brings out the bassline."""

The most detailed sampled Chromatic Harmonica on the planet\r\r
\r\r
Play harmonica like Stevie Wonder or Toots Thielemans - but on your MIDI-keyboard.\r\r
With almost 7.000 samples, 14 articulations, up to 8 dynamic-layers and a full range of 4 octaves, CH-Harmonica is definitely the most detailedly sampled Chromatic Harmonica on the planet. The user interface holds tons of features on several pages to shape the sound the way you want it. However, if you do not feel like editing, just play and explore the 26 pre-programmed Key-Switch presets ranging from A-1 to A#1 on the lower keys of your MIDI-keyboard.\r\r
To achieve the feeling of a live performance, the user interface offers four "Dynamic Modes", „Key-Vibrato“, „Hot-Keys“ and a revolutionary new concept of articulation presets .\r\r
One of the most unique features in CH-Harmonica are the Phase-Aligned samples. After six months of research, Chris Hein found a solution to phase-synchronize the samples. This enables an absolutely perfect blending between six dynamic layers.\r\r
During the development of CH-Harmonica, most attention was spent on how to work with dynamic expression.\r\r

We were very happy when Berthold Matschat gave us permission to sample his rare harmonica. There are very few chromatic harmonica players worldwide, and he is the leading player in Germany. Berthold Matschat is also an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. Since he extensively works with sampled instruments in his own studio, he had a detailed concept of what needed to be played on and sampled of the harmonica.\r\r
His tone is particularly soulful and emotional. We recorded an old rare Hohner Harmonica, that dates back to those times, when Hohner could impress with the words “Made in Germany”.\r\r

The Cosmic Darkness\r\r
\r\r
A journey into the future of sound turned dark and gritty fast. In Best Service - Dark Horizon, by Sonuscore, Elysion’s famous ensemble engine has been hijacked, augmented, and vaporized. With the drifting cosmic remains, Dark Horizon molds the future into a dystopian atmosphere of massive basses, cosmic arps, and drifting pads. Turn simple chords into unreal, nightmarish space-scapes, while moving the mod-wheel bends time and transports you into the dark, disparate corners of eldritch furies.\r\r
\r\r
* Experience the diversity of 80 instantly playable, bass-heavy instruments.\r\r
* Experience the infinite depth of over 1.2GB of sample content.\r\r
* Experience the flexibility of 180 complex animated and fully customizable themes.\r\r
\r\r
Dark Horizon is an earth-shattering bass-heavy synth built using synthesizers and a variety of sounds bent and warped into fascinating soundscapes and powerful low ends. Dark Horizon is built from the same engine as ELYSION, creating an even darker sound palette with new presets, themes, and effects. \r\r
\r\r
For Extraordinary and Dark Bass Sound\r\r
\r\r
With a focus on dark, dirty bass sounds, Dark Horizon pushes levels and tones not yet explored by the Elysion series. Space engineer Tobias Menguser sent wavs into the far reaches of the cosmos, beyond the known universe, where only the terrifying nightmares and figments of reality lurk. In those unknown places, the sounds were twisted and experimented upon, crafting a full sound palette of dark and low basses. They mutated into growling instruments, screaming oscillations, and ground-shaking subs.\r\r
For Modern Producers and Score Composers\r\r
For ambient, modern electronic, and experimental music, Dark Horizon can bring a new power into your work with its library of grinds and grooves. For scoring and blockbusters, these sounds make for perfect tension-building underscore.\r\r
Dark Horizon  - What´s Included?\r\r
As the deep underbelly of the Elysion series, Dark Horizon is a powerful Kontakt instrument that resynthesizes orchestral sounds and sound FX along with a great variety of rare analog synths and FX boxes. The resulting instruments are mind-crushing sounds, gut-wrenching themes, rhythmic arps, whirling pads, and a set of effects to push them even further beyond the imagination.\r\r
\r\r
* Ambient - Resynthesized - Cinematic - Dark Horizon pushes sounds into unrecognizable extremes, utilizing analogue rack effects and the dark powers of eldritch gods. Use Dark Horizon as a scoring tool for any project that needs a dose of profound bass and gritty depth or use it as a really exceptional synth to create innovative melodies with outstanding sonic power.\r\r
* Layered - Dirty - Powerful - With four layers of sounds and an onboard compressor, delay, and hall reverb, create unique and disturbing combinations for a truly original experience. Each layer is linked to an independent arpeggiator and two pan engines, allowing you to easily create complex, evolving pads.\r\r
* Sampling Redefined - Bursting with Expression and Variety - We recorded, sampled and produced the sounds, treating them like acoustic instruments. This results in an unimaginable dynamic and unprecedented sound. Integrated into the pathbreaking ensemble engine, Dark Horizon further expands our strongest composing lineup, together with Elysion 2 and The Orchestra.\r\r
Score the Dark with a Familiar User Interface\r\r
\r\r
Users of Elysion and The Orchestra will find Dark Horizon’s user interface familiar, with all the essential controls in the same places or intuitive to find.\r\r
\r\r
* Main Page - Select instruments, presets and control all layers from the main page. Play up to 4 instruments simultaneously.\r\r
* Ensemble Engine - Modify and perfect your sounds to the very last detail with the critically-acclaimed ensemble engine. Create exciting new sonic experiences by simply playing some chords.\r\r
* Mix Page - Mix & pan your layers and breathe live and dynamic variation into every single pattern.\r\r
* Motion Engine - Customize the instruments fundamentally, steering e.g. attack or decay vi MIDI CC.\r\r
* Preset Browser - Explore the massive selection of presets using intuitive filters and categories.\r\r
* Pan Engine - Create outstanding motion and effects by controlling and automating the panning of the sounds.\r\r
\r\r
Powerful Features - Supernatural Workflow\r\r
\r\r
Dark Horizon features the critically acclaimed ensemble technology, empowering you to create complex sounds by playing simple chords.\r\r
\r\r
* Modified Ensemble Engine - Dark Horizon uses a modified version of the Elysion ensemble engine. This means you can play up to four different instrument modules at the same time, and each module allows independent controls for arpeggiators. Using the mod-wheel unlocks an astounding filter effect that produces a great number of kinetic, digital possibilities.\r\r
* Motion Engine - Dark Horizon comes with its own unique dynamic FX engine. It allows the fundamental customization of the instruments, e.g. steering attack or decay via Midi CC. Besides other FX the Motion Engine includes also two Pan Steppers, breathing live and variation into every pattern in no time.\r\r
\r\r
Once you have been inspired by a theme in ’, drag and drop the arrangement of your performance to your DAW. Now you are free to use it within every library you own. Unleash the power of the ensemble engine onto your personal template, change notes, combine different patterns and make them your own. Experience the incredible efficiency of Dark Horizon, Elysion 2 and The Orchestra merging together within your DAW.\r\r
\r\r
Maximize Your Creativity\r\r
\r\r
Dark Horizon comes with 180 complex animated and fully customizable themes, spread across five different categories. Each category has its unique style and purpose, providing you with either rhythmic elements, dark textures or sounds that are perfect for playing melodies.\r\r
\r\r
* Poly Animations - Complex rhythms for chords that push the audio floor with movement and vibration. The modwheel modifies the arps and filters, increasing the tension, while introducing horn blasts, braahms, and drones.\r\r
* Rhythmic Pulses - Low pulsing basses with complex arpeggiations reveal great dynamic range when the modwheel is pushed, morphing the rhythms and raising the filters.\r\r
* Mono Arpeggios - Legato arpeggios arranged in danceable grooves with the modwheel pressing the frequencies and creating a much sharper tone.\r\r
* Lowest Textures - Dark, tension-filled drones complimented by screeching impulses, filter swipes, and stellar reverb effects at the turn of the modwheel.\r\r
* Playable Sounds - Wide cosmic pads and gently gliding legatos, this set includes the bulk of the playable content. The modwheel releases all the built up anger and tension as the frequencies push.\r\r

Emotional Cello – never before, a virtual instrument could be played with this level of expression.\r\r
\r\r
The Emotional Cello from the Munich-based developers Harmonic Subtones is a virtual instrument that features a powerful and emotional sound and opens up unknown dimensions of expression.\r\r
Whether film scoring, pop music productions, songwriting, classical music or modern, avant-garde cello compositions, the Emotional Cello shines through a variety of contained articulations, a direct and unadulterated sound as well as unusual playing techniques and rebowing.\r\r
\r\r
Contextual Sampling\r\r
\r\r
"Contextual Sampling" is what the developers of Emotional Cello call the philosophy behind this project in which all samples are always recorded in a musical context to capture the natural bowing and expressiveness of real instrumentalists. In this approach the recordings of a real vibrato play an important role, as they are always more inspiring and organic than adding an artificial vibrato.\r\r
\r\r
Articulations, Patches & True Legato\r\r
\r\r
Emotional Cello was created from well over 100 articulations and their variants. By means of an elaborate and intelligent script, countless articulations are linked together in a meaningful way so that they follow the playing style of the user.\r\r
The library contains three master patches, including the "Emotional Cello", the "Sulponticello" and the "Harmonic Cello". These contain most of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. Three different transition types have been captured in several sessions and simulate, among other things, realistic changes in bowing direction or passionate portamento while playing. The user simply controls the velocity - the tempo of the tone transitions automatically adapts to your DAW!\r\r
In addition to the Master Patch, the Emotional Cello also contains an Individuals Patch which is a set of key switch patches with different articulations of the same category such as sustains, shorts, trills and more. The Specials Patch offers some unusual articulations and effects and the Stackable Patch contains the main articulations with standardized key switching to match the stackable patches of Emotional Violin & Emotional Viola.\r\r
\r\r
Selection of the included playing styles:\r\r
Spiccimo & frog, Stacc, Fast Spiccato, Frog Madness, Pizzicato, Delicate, Delicate fast, Proud Vibrato\r\r
Hero Vibrato, Martele half NV 8RR, Martele half Vib 4RR, Pickup, Fortepiano, Vivid, Paganini Run, Moderate 2, Sustain Non Vib XFDe, Expressive XFDe, Pastorale, Pastorale slow, Tremolo, Trill HAT,\r\r
Trill WT.\r\r
\r\r
Ornament Key Switches\r\r
\r\r
The Ornament Key Switches are another great feature. Unlike the articulation key switches, these are temporary and allow variations of the already selected articulation. By pressing one of the Ornament Key Switches, the current playing style can be faded into another articulation or variations can be generated. Last but not least, the Ornament MKS offer typical effects like glissando, flageolet and many more.\r\r
\r\r
The Effects\r\r
\r\r
In order to customize the sound of the Cello according to your wishes, you can use effects specially designed for the instrument. These include a 3-band EQ, a switchable sordino and a timbre function. The latter contains 15 convolution-based presets from renowned and experienced sound engineers for easy and characteristic modulation of the basic sound.\r\r
For the use of the Cello as 1st chair cello in an orchestral environment, there are also timbre EQs which place the viola in its correct position in the orchestra room. The final touch is provided by the "Room" and "Reverb" modules, which use professionally recorded convolution reverb presets to reproduce the sound of real rooms and can also be adjusted separately.\r\r
\r\r
You are the artist!\r\r
\r\r
The interface of the Emotional Cello has some advanced features to make it easier for you to play the library. For example, "PolyLegato" recognizes whether you are playing a bound melody line or a chord, and "Legato Trimming" allows you to manually adjust the speed of legato and portamento transitions.\r\r
The Attack function allows you to add an additional start sample independent of the currently selected articulation in order to let short notes flow in during legato playing or to simulate harsh starting notes. Correct tuning is also taken care of: Using the "Micro Tuning Option", the most popular tunings can be applied to the viola, and completely new tunings can be created.\r\r
\r\r
The Recording\r\r
\r\r
Emotional Cello was recorded in the Mastermix Studio near Munich, in a wood-panelled room with high ceilings and the greatest possible distance from the wall. For the greatest possible flexibility of use, two Neumann microphones, type KM184 and U87, were used for close recording. In this way, the room was kept quite subtle, and you can then create your desired sound with your own effects. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.\r\r

The most expressive and detailed virtual Viola available\r\r
\r\r
Emotional Viola is the third member of the Emotional Strings series by Harmonic Subtones. This long anticipated and logical addition to the cello and violin, represents a very comprehensive virtual instrument that is easy to play, and of course offers numerous possibilities for individual customization.\r\r
Not only does the Emotional Viola harmonize excellently with the cello and the violin, it is also highly valued as a solo instrument with its direct and unadulterated sound, its variety of essential to extraordinary articulations as well as true legato and rebowing.\r\r

Emotional Violin - the most expressive virtual violin of all time\r\r
\r\r
If you are looking for the perfect instrument for film scoring, pop music, songwriting, classical or modern avant-garde violin compositions, the Emotional Violin is your first choice! A unique, virtual instrument that convinces through its variety of articulations, its direct and unadulterated sound and functions like True Legato and Rebowing. With its impressive and at the same time emotional sound, it enables expressions that have never been achieved before.\r\r
\r\r
Contextual Sampling\r\r
\r\r
Our philosophy during the recordings is called "Contextual Sampling". In order to find the perfect sound, several string instruments were sampled in various ways over a period of four years. We came to the conclusion that no technique comes even close to the actual and natural vibrato of a trained musician. The samples of true legato were always much more inspiring and had a more organic feel than added artificial legato. So our goal was to perfectly capture these musical aspects and combine them into a great sounding and easy to play instrument.\r\r
Emotional Violin consists of more than 100 articulations and their variations. Through elaborate, intelligent scripting countless articulations were usefully linked, so that they follow the user’s style of playing. This is the secret of Emotional Violin that makes for its exceedingly realistic and authentic sound.\r\r
\r\r
Master Patches & True Legato\r\r
\r\r
Emotional Violin contains three Master Patches, including „Emotional Violin“ and „Intimate Violin“. These contain a multitude of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. In total, 3 different transition types were captured in countless sessions, which perfectly simulate bow changes or passionate portamento, easily controlled via velocity. The speed of the transitions automatically matches your DAW’s tempo.\r\r
\r\r
Ornament Keyswitches\r\r
\r\r
A special highlight are the Ornament Keyswitches. Unlike the articulation keyswitches, these are designed for the moment, to bring variations into chosen articulations. This way you can blend from a current playing style to another one (e.g. trills and tremolos) or you can generate variations (e.g. bow changes, to smoothly end a note), just by pushing an Ornament Keyswitch (e.g. trills and tremolos). Last but not least the Ornament MKS offer typical violin-effects like glissando (up and down), flageolett and many more.\r\r
\r\r
Effective sound shaping\r\r
\r\r
Emotional Violin offers a small but mighty collection of sound shaping possibilities, specifically tailored to the instrument. Aside from a typical 3-band EQ and a connectable sordino you will find timbre functions.\r\r
4 famous and experienced sound engineers created these convolution based presets (so called\r\r
Timbre Impulses) that allow for an easy and characterful modulation of the violin sound. To use the violin as 1st Chair Violin in an orchestral arrangement, we added a timbre EQ that places the violin in the correct orchestral seating. The icing on the cake are modules „Room“ and „Reverb“, which provide the sound of actual rooms, thanks to professionally recorded convolution presets - plus they can be tweaked separately.\r\r
\r\r
You are the artist!\r\r
\r\r
To meet the requirements of your playing, Emotional Violin offers additional features. At „Poly Legato“, for example, it automatically recognises whether a bound melody line or an chord is played and via „Legato Trimming“ you can manually set the speed of legato and portamento transitions. A speciality represents the attack feature, which enables the user to add a start sample independent of the selected articulation - for instance to add short or harsh starting notes during legato. The correct tuning is also provided: via the „Micro Tuning Option“ you can apply established tunings to the violin (e.g. pythagorean, Werkmeister III, and many more) or create entirely new ones.\r\r
\r\r
The result is a library with unsurpassed authenticity\r\r
\r\r
Emotional Violin offers a multitude of articulations - also unusual ones - you won’t find in any other library. Aside from the 3 big Master Patches, you will find more than 70 articulations structured in categories and available as Multi-Keyswitch-Patches - from expressive sustains, to pinpoint shorts with up 9 Round Robins, to trills and exotic effects, to dynamic crossfades within four layers. You can deactivate unused playing styles / keyswitches at any time via the „Purge“ feature, freeing up working storage for other instruments. So if you prefer to not work exclusively with keyswitches, this method perfectly suits you.\r\r
Simply select from one of the following\r\r
Normal Sustains with and without Vibrato, Multiple Progressive Vibratos, Multiple Espressivo, Flautando, Sul Ponticello, Morbid Sustains, Harmonics, Multiple Spiccatos, Staccato, Marcato, Tremolo, Tremolo Sul Ponticello, Multiple Trills, Pizzicato, Pizzicato Snap, Paganini Pizzicato, Scratches, Piazolla FX, Diverse Violin Effekte, Violin Percussions\r\r
\r\r
The Recording\r\r
\r\r
The Emotional Violin was recorded at the Mastermix Studio near Munich in a wood-panelled room with a large ceiling height and at the greatest possible distance to the wall. For maximum flexibility, two Neumann KM184 and U87 microphones were used very closely. Therefore the room amount is quite subtle, so you can use your own effects for further processing. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.\r\r

The ultimate Sample-library for Ethnic Instruments from all over the World\r\r
\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the summit of a library that has continuously been growing and improving for over 16 years. In this sixth edition, numerous new instruments with a volume of several gigabytes have been added to the library.\r\r
Award-winning film composer Marcel Barsotti (e. g. Pope Joan, The Miracle of Bern) has gathered a gigantic selection of instruments from all over the word from widely varying cultures.\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments now consists of 264 instruments, with roughly 620 patches, 10 construction sets and 5 shaker sets. For the most authentic sound, the instruments were recorded with different play techniques that can easily and precisely be accessed from the patches via key-switches. The library consists of 24.7 gigabytes (uncompressed) of sample data and 23,559 samples. All instruments come in 24 bit and 44.1 kHz.\r\r
Over 70 musicians from all over world were involved in the recording process, conducted by music-producer Andreas Hofner. The recordings took place in different local studios with the use of first-class gear such as microphones by Neumann and Brauner, SPL preamplifiers and converters by RME.\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments comprises an incredible spectrum of instruments from the most diverse regions of Asia, Africa, Europe, North- and South-America. Here, you will find the perfect instruments for folkloric, ethnic as well as for modern music.\r\r
Library size ~ 15 GB (using Kontakt´s lossless compression)\r\r
Kontakt / Kontakt Player 5.6 or newer required!\r\r
\r\r
INSTRUMENTS\r\r
\r\r
The library contains an extensive selection of stringed, plucked and bowed instruments, as well as the most different woodwinds including numerous flutes and, of course, a large selection of drums and percussion.\r\r
Alongside film-score-proven taikos and big ethnic tom drums, there are hundreds of inspiring loops and even an entire "Gongs, Bells & Metal Type Instruments" category - ranging from the large big feng gong to delicately sparkling wind chimes. New in ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments are some unique sounds such as the two meter spanning gong by Paiste, several new percussion-instruments and a waterphone.\r\r
Almost all sections of the predecessor have been expanded once again. In addition, a couple of instruments of ETHNO WORLD 5 have been re-recorded. Among them is a new mandolin and a great sounding banjo, programmed with countless articulations and licks by one of Germany’s best banjo-players, Rüdiger Helbig.\r\r
Furthermore, you will now find a concertina, an autoharp, a Japanese koto, the aforementioned new mandolin with multiple play styles, a South-American charango, a bansuri, bass quena and an Indian flute plus additional play styles for the instruments launeddas, mancosedda, dvojacka and the Irish traverse flute.\r\r
With its selection of instruments, ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the perfect library for film- and television productions that demand authentic sounds from specific regions of the world. Naturally, these instruments will work in music productions of diverse genres that embrace these specific sonic elements - from pop to ambient to dance.\r\r
\r\r
CONTENT\r\r
\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments contains all sounds of the previous versions, categorised in “Bowed Instruments”, “Stringed Instruments”, “Woodwind & Brass”, “Key Instruments”, “World Drums”, “World Percussion” and “Gongs, Bells & Metals”.\r\r
A good number of special instruments were additionally recorded for version 6. Among them is the new “Gamelan” category. The instruments were recorded in Munich's Stadtmuseum and contain two different gamelan orchestras from Bali and Java, available in slendro, pelog and international tunings. Here, you will find more than 25 instruments such as kempli, kendhang drums, cheng cheng, bells, kecer cymbals, kethuk and kempiang.\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments also unlocks an entire new region by offering a complete ensemble of alpine folk music including plucked instruments, brass as well as male and female yodelers. Find instruments like the Styrian harmonica, a nylon stringed concert guitar, zither, raffele, dulcimer, alpenhorn, flugelhorn, trumpet, trombone, tuba, folk-violin and two clarinets. And of course it includes an acoustic bass.\r\r
For historical contexts, such as historic dramas or fantasy movies, ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments offers a large selection of medieval instruments, among them a hurdy gurdy, renaissance lute, fife, doucaine, shawm, pasalterium, pump organ and a shruti box. In a nutshell: every instrument for songs about fire and ice.\r\r
\r\r
THE INTERFACE\r\r
\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments uses the free Kontakt 5 Player by Native Instruments as its sample-engine and can of course be used with the full version of Kontakt 5, too. For the new version, the user-interface's graphic has been completely redesigned and optimized for ultra fast access. There are numerous editing possibilities as well as innovative functions. ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments supports the Native Kontrol Standard (NKS), which allows tagging and interaction with the NI Komplete Kontrol keyboards and NI Maschine.\r\r
Further additions are a new waveform display, visualization of the sample-start-offset as well as a clearer use of the effects where, among other features, delay times are now displayed in tempo-related note values and milliseconds. The Timemachine (TM PRO) delivers significantly improved audio results with tempo adapted material, especially for polyphonic licks and loops.\r\r
And this is not only a benefit for the latest sounds of ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments but also for all sounds of ETHNO WORLD 5 which were completely revised in this regard. At the same time, the number of patches has been reduced, leading to a clearer menu structure.\r\r
Thanks to the integrated convolution reverb, all instruments sound exceptionally realistic and natural. Solo instruments additionally offer a high-quality legato mode. Plus, the humanize mode will play each new note with a slightly changed timbre. The micro-tuning allows the use of multiple ethnical tunings and scales. By using top-quality filters, LFOs, tune, automation, harmonizer and further effects, all instruments and voices can be efficiently edited and manipulated if needed - allowing to create new sonic worlds equally suited for modern music genres and film productions.\r\r
A unique feature of ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the integrated IDB-INFO (Information Database), being directly available from every instrument. Via the menu entry "IDB-INFO", you can access photos of the instruments as well as many details about their original play techniques and tunings, origins and variations. You will also find notes on how to use key-switches, achieving realistic results with the corresponding instrument. \r\r
\r\r
Vocal Expansion\r\r
\r\r
In addition to ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments, the separate dedicated vocal-library ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices is available. This library offers perfectly matching extensive solo-voices, phrases and choirs from Cameroon, Guinea, China, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Northern Africa, Spain and Ukraine. For version 6, the voices and choirs have been expanded by new contributions from Africa, Arabia, Jamaica and India.\r\r

CONTENT\r\r
\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices comprises an incredible spectrum of voices from the most diverse regions of the world. Here, you will find the fitting voice-recordings for folkloric, ethnic as well as for modern music. The library offers extensive solo-voices, phrases and choirs from Cameroon, Guinea, China, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Northern Africa, Spain and Ukraine. The voices and choirs have been expanded by new contributions from Africa, Arabia, Jamaica and India. For example, the Houari Algerian rai singer is not only perfect for creating authentic atmospheres but also for EDM and Hip-Hop.\r\r
Equally extraordinary are the Balinese and Mongolian overtone singings, the voices of the Chinese opera, Arabian, Indian and African choirs and solo-voices as well as the chants of American natives. Thus, there is a versatile choice of voices for the wide range of film-scoring, ethnic- or traditional music and also for modern music productions.\r\r
With its selection of voice-recordings, ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices is the perfect library for film- and television productions that demand authentic sounds from specific regions of the world.

For a detailed listing of all voices please go to "More Infos".\r\r
\r\r
THE INTERFACE\r\r
\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices uses the free Kontakt 5 Player by Native Instruments as its sample-engine and can of course be used with the full version of Kontakt 5, too. For the new version, the user-interface's graphic has been completely redesigned and optimized for ultra fast access. There are numerous editing possibilities as well as innovative functions. ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices supports the Native Kontrol Standard (NKS), which allows tagging and interaction with the NI Komplete Kontrol keyboards and NI Maschine.\r\r
Further additions are a new waveform display, visualization of the sample-start-offset as well as a clearer use of the effects where, among other features, delay times are now displayed in tempo-related note values and milliseconds. The Timemachine (TM PRO) delivers significantly improved audio results with tempo adapted material, especially for polyphonic licks and loops.\r\r
And this is not only a benefit for the latest sounds of ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices but also for all sounds of ETHNO WORLD 5 which were completely revised in this regard. At the same time, the number of patches has been reduced, leading to a clearer menu structure.\r\r
Thanks to the integrated convolution reverb, all voices sound exceptionally realistic and natural. By using top-quality filters, LFOs, tune, automation, harmonizer and further effects, all instruments and voices can be efficiently edited and manipulated if needed - allowing to create new sonic worlds equally suited for modern music genres and film productions.\r\r
\r\r
Instrumental Extension\r\r
\r\r
ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices is the perfect choice whenever voices with a specific cultural coloring are needed for your productions. The solo-voices, phrases and choirs can be combined with almost any musical genre. If you aim for fully authentic productions of folkloric or traditional music, ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments with its gigantic pool of string, wind, drum and percussion instruments is the perfect extension to ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices.\r\r

Mystica – where world class vocalists meet the topmost innovative library designer and superior studio gear\r\r
\r\r
With Mystica, Eduardo Tarilonte continues his incomparable series of vocal-libraries. This classical chamber choir consists of eight extraordinary female vocalists, delivering a unique, enchanting sound without comparison.\r\r
Mystica was designed as a female-choir-library for unconfined solo use. At the same time, the library forms a perfectly matched mixed choir when being combined with Cantus. Therefore, Mystica was recorded under identical conditions in spanish KBYO Recording Studios, located in Granada, using eight selected Neumann microphones and Avalon preamps.\r\r
\r\r
Cantus cover\r\r
\r\r
To ensure perfect team play of both libraries, Mystica offers the same words and Phrase-Arranger as Cantus. In addition, there is a new feature for quick-exchanging phrases and wordbuilder-settings between the libraries - in both directions. This way, the combination of Mystica and Cantus forms an impressive tool to create overwhelming choir passages.\r\r
Mystica is an unparalleled choir with an extraordinary sound quality. Mystica offers an almost magical sound which is extraordinarily versatile and equally suited for esoteric and mystic melodies as well as for big cinematic passages. One of the benefits of Mystica is its wonderful, expressive „True Legato“.\r\r
\r\r
Mystica unifies realism and inspiration\r\r
\r\r
This unrivaled choir-library allows creating incredibly realistic choir-phrases with ease. Mystica's powerful and innovative wordbuilder combines 24 words in the form of 120 elements, consisting of full words, corresponding syllables and five True-Legato vowels (A, E, I, O, U) plus an additional “Mmmh“-articulation.\r\r
As every Tarilonte vocal-library, Mystica offers the brilliant and innovative option of combining each word with any of the five True-Legato vowels, too. This way, realistically sounding vocal phrases can be created without using ready-made phrases.\r\r
Nevertheless, Mystica can, of course, be used as a typical choir-library without its Phrase-Arranger. There is an ample choice of 100 Gregorian vocal phrases, allowing to create sacral atmospheres with ease. In addition, the library offers twelve soundscapes being formed from vocal recordings as well as vocal effects to create unusual sounds.\r\r
\r\r
Mystica Features:\r\r
\r\r
* unique „Numen Ensemble“ female choir with eight vocalists\r\r
* 5 GB WAV samples, 24 bit/44.1 kHz\r\r
* 5 “True Legato” vowels (A, E, I, O, U), separate “Mmmh”-articulation\r\r
* powerful Phrase-Arranger with 24 words and three different articulations (staccato, fast, slow)\r\r
* words can be separated in 120 short words/syllables\r\r
* combine words with True-Legato vowels - automatic vowel selection\r\r
* 100 Gregorian vocal phrases\r\r
* 12 soundscapes, moulded from vocal recordings\r\r
* additional vocal effects\r\r
* new import/export functions to exchange Phrase-Arranger patches between Mystica and Cantus\r\r
* dry recordings, perfect to be spiced up with individual reverberation\r\r
\r\r
The female choir selected by Tarilonte is the “Numen Ensemble”, founded 2011. This choir is formed by experienced and talented vocalists with broad vocal repertoire. Most singers have been or still are members of renowned ensembles such as the Baroque Sevilla Choir, the Choir of the Maestranza or the Choir of the City of Granada Symphonic Orchestra."""

The Orchestra Complete 3 - New Features - New Instruments - New Presets\r\r
\r\r
"The Orchestra Complete 3" combines the powerful orchestration capabilities that have made "The Orchestra" recognized in the composition community with brand-new articulations and the most effective new features ever. Composing faster, more freely, and more uniquely has never been simpler.\r\r
The third version, which includes all three "The Orchestra" expansions, is filled with thrilling potential and power. Among them are "Horns Of Hell", which features a diabolical "evil brass" section, "Strings Of Winter", which features a 41-piece string orchestra and captures the wild spirit of nature, and "Woods Of The Wild", which re-energizes the woodwinds to catch all that is evocative in their breath.\r\r
In addition to  these expansions comes the all-in-one package of the base orchestra, a top-quality-recorded 80-piece orchestra with a massive array of articulations and a groundbreaking ensemble engine that has been rebuilt and expanded upon. It's now simpler than ever to turn your ideas into music.\r\r
\r\r
What´s Included?\r\r
\r\r
"The Orchestra Complete 3" extends our entry-level instrument "The Orchestra" with more instruments, more presets and extended powerful features. Now including:\r\r

* Pure Performance Legato - We are pleased to present a powerful legato engine that has undergone a complete redesign. Because the engine can differentiate between the two articulations without the use of keyswitches, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any hassles.\r\r
* Main Page: Voicing Selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or choose from over 90 pre-arranged Voicings. The Ensemble Engine is just like having a real-life orchestrator working for you.\r\r
* Additional presets and multi-instruments - Discover how the Voicings (208 presets), Rhythms (239 presets), and Animated Orchestra settings (223 presets) work with the 5-part arranging engine by exploring the presets to get the most out of "The Orchestra Complete 3". Updated Voicings that use and bring together the expanded libraries in innovative and expressive ways are also included in "The Orchestra Complete 3".\r\r
* MIDI Export - "The Orchestra Complete 3" comes with MIDI-Export. Patterns and arrangements generated by the engine can be exported onto separate MIDI Tracks, opening endless possibilities.\r\r
\r\r
The Core – The Ensemble Engine\r\r
\r\r

\r\r
Create Complex Arrangements With Simple Chords\r\r
\r\r
Create pulsating rhythms and inspiring full arrangements with simple chords and without the use of any pre-recorded phrases. At the heart of "The Orchestra Complete 3" is the Ensemble Engine, which allows this inspiring dance of instruments and rhythms to unfold before your very eyes with only the press of a chord.\r\r
\r\r
* 3 independent arpeggiators and 2 velocity envelopes can be assigned to create vivid and powerful orchestral voicings\r\r

* Load up to 5 different instruments in independent slots and play them together.\r\r
* Every slot can be assigned to one of five different modules.\r\r
* Assign percussion to the arpeggiator to create pulsating rhythms.\r\r
* Voicings selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or you can choose from our 90+ pre-arranged Voicings.\r\r
\r\r
Compose Faster with Full Instrumental Groups\r\r
\r\r
Choose from nearly 700 Presets in Three Categories.\r\r
\r\r
* Orchestral Voicings - Orchestral Voicings include various playable arrangements of instruments that create the fullest and richest orchestral sound.\r\r
* Orchestral Rhythms - Orchestral Rhythms presets bring you cinematic and expressive rhythms that take full advantage of the Ensemble Engine.\r\r
* Animated Orchestra - Making full use of all the possibilities of the Ensemble Engine, the Animated Orchestra presets are for the most complex and magical musical ideas.\r\r
\r\r
Export Your Custom Performance\r\r
\r\r

Unleash the power of the Customizer Engine onto your personal template, change notes, combine different patterns, and make them your own.\r\r
\r\r
Take Full Control Over The Ensemble\r\r
\r\r
Work quickly and intuitively with our straightforward user interface.\r\r
On the Engine page you can access all individual controls for each of the five instrument modules. Short notes can be arranged with the arpeggiators, while sustained notes can be shaped with the velocity envelope. Create the orchestral colors as you need them and let the magic happen.\r\r
\r\r
* Arpeggiator - The arpeggiator creates fascinating melodic patterns to give your project a rich and lively orchestral feeling. Change the pattern of the arpeggiator with the rhythm stepper. If needed, you can modify almost every parameter to stay in full control of your orchestral voicing.\r\r
* Sequence Designer - The Sequence Designer is included in the arpeggiator. This allows you to create in detail your own musical passages. Instead of following the specific styles of preset arpeggios, create your own and make it as complex as you’d like.\r\r
* Velocity Envelope - Shape your sustain sounds with the Velocity Envelope, adding to your sound a recurring dynamic movement from a sustained note. The centerpiece is the envelope shape, which can be drawn freely.\r\r
\r\r
Play Over 280 Instruments / Articulations Freely\r\r
\r\r
Create full and detailed orchestrations from scratch. Play your ideas and your melodies freely with countless single instruments. Included are all standard sections and articulations from a symphonic orchestra, including percussion as well as tonal percussion (Marimbaphone, Vibraphone, Xylophone and Glockenspiel) and as a bonus: choir, piano, cembalo, celesta and a massive church organ.\r\r
\r\r
Pure Performance Legato\r\r
\r\r
With our Pure Performance Legato technology, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any problems, as the engine can distinguish between both articulations without the need for keyswitches. Special attention was paid to the integration of the true legato transitions, fitting each of the more than 400 transitions per instrument independently into the intervals in a way that allows for a very smooth and playable legato.\r\r
\r\r
Ensemble-Multi Patches: Unleash The Full Orchestral Power\r\r
\r\r
Multis take the Ensemble Engine even further toward instant playability and epic sound as they load and layer multiple instances of "The Orchestra". The easiest way to create complex orchestral arrangements.\r\r
There are full playable orchestral multis for single articulations that work perfectly for quick sketching and layering. Orchestral Rhythm and Animated Orchestra Multis combine multiple instances of the Ensemble Engine to create even more complex patterns.\r\r
\r\r
The Samples: Rough, Unpolished And Human\r\r
\r\r
"The Orchestra" was recorded and processed with the intention to sound a bit rougher and more “honest” than the common Hollywood-sounding orchestra vst. It offers an alternative and promises straight and powerful sounds, punch and a vivid musical experience.\r\r
The instruments for "The Orchestra" were recorded in Budapest at the renowned Studio 22 in their traditional seating position and mixed and edited with great attention to detail. This way the different sections blend together perfectly in the same room. All essential articulations are available, including playable true legato samples and multiple round robins for short articulations.\r\r
\r\r
Preset Browser\r\r

Ambient Black is the second of a linked pair of sound design-based virtual instruments designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original instruments and textures suitable for all sorts of ambient music.\r\r
\r\r
As its name implies, Ambient Black covers the darker end of the ambient spectrum, focusing on harsh, aggressive, atonal, mysterious, and industrial sounds. Ambient White, the first VI in this series, covers the opposite end of the ambient spectrum.\r\r
\r\r
The majority of sounds used in the creation of Ambient Black were derived from organic sources: found sounds and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques, prepared and heavily processed musical instruments, and sounds recorded in natural environments. The synth sounds were also processed with sound design techniques, and combined with various organic sounds and instruments.\r\r
\r\r
The end result is a product that combines acoustic, human, industrial, and electronic elements to produce an organic-sounding virtual instrument.\r\r
\r\r
THE INSTRUMENT PATCHES\r\r
\r\r
Ambient Black features over 280 different instrument patches and combinations (over 6.5 GB of uncompressed WAV data), divided into seven categories:\r\r
\r\r
1. Multi-Layered Instruments\r\r
2. Drones & Atmospheres\r\r
3. Bass Instruments\r\r
4. Percussive Instruments\r\r
5. Melodic Instruments\r\r
6. Looped Instrument Phrases\r\r
7. Effects & Textures\r\r
\r\r
The most complex instrument patches in Ambient Black are the Multi-Layered Instruments, created using combinations of patches from the other six categories. These patches are organized by their basic type, using the following prefixes:\r\r
\r\r
* ATMOS: Layered Atmospheres and Pads\r\r
* BASS: Layered Bass Instruments\r\r
* FX: Layered Effects & Textures\r\r
* LOOP: Layered Looped Phrases\r\r
* MELO: Layered Melodic Instruments\r\r
* PERC: Layered Percussive Instruments\r\r
\r\r
MULTI-LAYERED INSTRUMENT PATCHES\r\r
\r\r
Many of the Multi-Layered Instrument patches consist of multiple evolving atmospheres, effects, textures, and looped phrases. For the best results, try playing these patches with one finger, or in octaves. This suggestion doesn't apply to Layered PERC patches, which in general don't have any pronounced melodic or harmonic content; playing multiple notes at a time with these layered patches can produce some interesting polyrhythmic patterns.\r\r
\r\r
EFFECTS & TEXTURES\r\r
\r\r
The Effects & Textures category includes a number of strange and aggressive sounds that were primarily designed to be used as cinematic sound design elements. Most don't have an identifiable pitch or key-center, and can be used as drones.\r\r
\r\r
PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS\r\r
\r\r
The Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic, industrial, and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of cinematic hits, glitches, industrial sounds, and other unusual percussive sounds.\r\r
\r\r
DRONES & ATMOSPHERES\r\r
\r\r
Many of the Drones & Atmospheres are long and evolve over time. Try holding a key for 10, 20, or even 30 seconds, and listen to how each of these sounds develop. Because most of these sounds are huge and dense, try playing just single notes or octaves.\r\r
\r\r
MELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS\r\r
\r\r
The Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as pads.\r\r
\r\r
LOOPED INSTRUMENTS\r\r
\r\r
The Looped Instruments include simple repeating patterns and some complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Some loops do not lock to tempo intentionally in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches. Looped Instruments should be played like the Drones & Atmospheres, using solo notes or octaves for less-complex patterns and different intervals for more experimental and harmonically-dense effects."""

The Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of tuned hand drums, cymbals and gongs, and other percussive sounds.\r\r
\r\r
PADS & ATMOSPHERES\r\r
\r\r
Many of the Pads & Atmospheres also include chordal components. When trying these patches for the first time, it's probably best to play them with one finger or in octaves. You can then experiment with playing different intervals, depending on the level of harmonic complexity you're looking for.\r\r
\r\r
MELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS\r\r
\r\r
The Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also few have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as Pads.\r\r
\r\r
LOOPED INSTRUMENT PHRASES\r\r
\r\r
The Looped Instrument Phrases include simple repeating patterns and some more-complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Many of the loops lock to tempo, but some do not; this was done intentionally, in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches. Looped Instrument Phrases should be played like the Pads & Atmospheres, using solo notes or octaves for less-complex patterns and different intervals for more experimental and harmonically-dense effects."""

Vintage Rhythm Section is a virtual instrument for Kontakt 5 designed to emulate the classic rhythm section sounds of R&B, Soul, Funk, Jazz, and Rock records from the 1960's and 1970's.\r\r
\r\r
Vintage Rhythm Section (VRS) is easy to use, with a simple interface that lets you work quickly and intuitively. If you're producing retro or indie-style music on a budget, or if you're a TV or film composer working on a tight deadline, VRS can be used to create live-sounding drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, and percussion tracks.\r\r
\r\r
CAPTURING THAT VINTAGE RHYTHM SECTION SOUND\r\r
\r\r
Like its sister-products, Vintage Horns and Vintage Strings, Vintage Rhythm Section was not designed to be a shiny, perfect-sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way rhythm sections sounded back in the 60's and 70's, including some of the minor imperfections that added character to those instruments and made them sound so good.\r\r
\r\r
For VRS, we sampled a large collection of vintage instruments - some amazingly still in mint condition, and others looking every bit as "vintage" as you'd expect a piece of 40-50 year-old gear to look.\r\r
\r\r
Wherever possible, we used the same types of amps and mics that were used in the 60's and 70's. Some of this old gear was pretty funky-sounding, which probably would have disqualified it from being used on most other types of sample libraries. But for VRS, it was just what we were looking for.\r\r
\r\r
VRS features two easy-to-use GUIs:\r\r
\r\r
1) A 12-channel mixer for drums\r\r
2) The main GUI, which is used for all of the keyboards, basses, and guitars.\r\r
\r\r
THE DRUM MIXER\r\r
\r\r
- Reverb Select: This is a drop-down menu that allows you to select various types of convolution IRs.\r\r
- Channel Strips: Each offers controls for Treble, Bass, Reverb Amount, Pan, and Solo/Mute. Note that not all kits have the same number of toms and cymbals. Instead, each kit was custom-built to fit the musical genre and era it came from.\r\r
- Master Channel: Allows you to add tape saturation (SAT) and/or compression (COMP) to the entire kit.\r\r
\r\r
THE MAIN GUI\r\r
\r\r
From top to bottom and left to right, this GUI has the following controls:\r\r
\r\r
- TAPE SAT adds tape-style saturation/compression\r\r
- TREBLE adds or cuts high end\r\r
- BASS adds or cuts low end\r\r
- DISTORTION SWITCH - use this to turn the effect on or off\r\r
- DISTORTION adds amp-style distortion\r\r
- DELAY controls the amount of tape-style delay\r\r
- DELAY SELECT allows you to choose from several types of delay\r\r
- ROTATOR SWITCH turs Leslie-style effect on or off\r\r
- ROTATOR allows you to select the speed of the Leslie-effect\r\r
- REVERB controls the amount of reverb added\r\r
- REVERB SELECT allows you to choose from a selection of high-quality Convolution Reverbs designed to replicate a number of vintage amp-reverbs and recording spaces\r\r
- MOD-WAH SWITCH turns on your controller's Mod Wheel as a wah-wah pedal\r\r
\r\r
Key-Switches\r\r
\r\r
Key-switching is a function that allows the user to quickly change from one articulation to another. If an instrument has any key-switch options, it will have red keys located on the far left of the Kontakt virtual keyboard. Many of the basses and guitars offer key-switched long and short (sustain and staccato) articulations, and some of the keyboards offer different key-switched presets."""

Vintage Strings is a virtual instrument for Kontakt 5 designed to emulate the classic violin string section sounds of R&B, Soul, and Funk records from the 1960's and 1970's. Whether you're an experienced arranger or casual producer, Vintage Strings was designed to make it quick and easy for you to create great sounding string tracks for your productions. Like its sister product, Vintage Horns, Vintage Strings was not designed to be a shiny, perfect sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way string sections sounded back in the '60s and '70s; including the decidedly not classical playing style and minor imperfections that added character to those sections and made them sound so good.\r\r
\r\r
For Vintage Strings we recorded a 6 piece violin section using vintage Neuman U-87 mics and Royer ribbon mics run through a great sounding SSL board. To capture a true vintage string sound, we used close mics, room mics, and string section positioning based on actual session notes from old Motown and Philly Soul recording sessions. Rather than record the violins in a magnificent concert hall or some other large and resonant recording space, we recorded our players in a funky old studio with a smaller, less-reverberant room that had characteristics similar to the rooms used to record classic Soul and R&B records. Using the tracks we recorded in this space, we then created three types of sections:\r\r
\r\r
2 VIOLINS:\r\r
\r\r
The 2VLN patches are very useful for creating the sound of smaller string sections. Even if played in 3-part harmony, these patches sound like a 6 piece section, rather than a full orchestral string section. The 2VLN patches take up a lot less sonic space in the mix, and also have the advantage of sounding like the smaller types of string sections used on a lot of old Soul and R&B records, which didn't have the time or budget to record a larger section.\r\r
\r\r
6 VIOLINS:\r\r
\r\r
The 6VLN patches are great for recording unison (1 part) lines that emulate the sound of a true 6 violin section, which was very commonly used in many old Soul recordings. When used for 2-part harmonies or octaves these patches can be used to replicate the sound of an overdubbed 6 violin section (i.e., a faux 12 violin section), which was a very common recording technique used on many Motown recording sessions.\r\r
\r\r
12 VIOLINS:\r\r
\r\r
The 12VLN patches are very useful for creating unison (1 part) string lines that sound like an overdubbed 6 violin section. If you want to get a bigger sound with the size of a larger orchestral string section, without the color and character present in a large recroding hall or symphonic space, use the patches for string parts in 2 or 3 part harmonies.\r\r
\r\r
The result is a virtual instrument that has a sound and character that is distinctly different from orchestral based sampled string libraries. The sound of Vintage Strings is intentionally not big, rich, and glossy. It's a smaller, more intimate, and more "human" sound, which more accurately emulates the string sound on those classic old records.\r\r
\r\r
FAST AND EASY STRING SECTION PARTS USING PRE-SET PATCHES\r\r
\r\r
If you don't have a lot experience writing for strings, or even if you're an experienced string-arranger on a tight deadline, Vintage Strings also offers a number of pre-programmed instrument patches that can help you quickly create great sounding string parts. These include the Tonal Harmonization Patches, which contain 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part patches for 2, 6, and 12 violins. Playing with just one finger on your keyboard you can easily write string lines in 2 parts (intervals), 3 parts (triads), or 4 parts (seventh chords). Secondly, the Tonal Harmonization patches include Fixed Chord & Interval Patches containing 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part Chord Patches, for 2, 6, and 12 violins. These patches are programmed to play a specific interval or chord according to the type of patch in 12 different keys.\r\r
\r\r
THE VINTAGE STRINGS GUI\r\r
\r\r
The Vintage Strings graphical user interface (GUI) is very simple and easy to use. The main page of the interface includes control over tape saturation, high EQ, and reverb with 15 custom selected convolution reverbs.\r\r
\r\r
THE HARMONIZE PAGE\r\r
\r\r
On the Harmonize page you can choose the key and scale of the interval or chord-based preset patches, or create custom interval and chord-based patches of your own.\r\r
\r\r

\r\r

description = """
Zodiac is a unique-sounding Virtual Instrument designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original sounds and instruments suitable for film or TV scores, video games, and all types of ambient and experimental music.\r\r
\r\r
No synthesizers were used to create the instruments in Zodiac. Instead, all instruments were created from organic sources such as found sounds, sonic manipulations inspired by classic Musique Concrete, Experimental and Avant Garde Music compositions, prepared or heavily processed musical instruments, and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques.\r\r
\r\r
Zodiac features over 200 patches and Multis (over 8GB of uncompressed wav data), divided into six categories:\r\r
\r\r
* Pads & Atmospheres\r\r
* Melodic Instruments\r\r
* Bass Instruments\r\r
* Percussive Instruments\r\r
* Experimental Instruments\r\r
* Zodiac Kits\r\r
\r\r
Zodiac's instruments range from beautiful and ethereal soundscapes to wildly inventive percussion and mysterious, haunting, atonal and experimental sounds that defy easy categorization. Search through Zodiac's patch folders, and you won't find anything like a regular bass, guitar, keyboard, or drum set. Instead, you'll find a collection of sounds that are quite unlike those made by any standard instrument.\r\r
\r\r
Not only does Zodiac feature a constellation of ready-to-use instrument patches, it's also a powerful sound-design VI. Use Zodiac's simple but versatile controls to dramatically alter, sculpt, or tweak and customize sounds to fit your individual style. However, you don't even need to touch a single control to get a variety of sounds from Zodiac's preset patches.\r\r
\r\r
Zodiac is made for experimentation: hold down a key on many instrument patches and a sound loops and morphs, revealing surprising musical timbres and harmonic strata. Play an instrument one way and it has a percussive quality; play it another, and the notes expand into a pad or atmosphere. Play a patch in one octave and it sounds dreamy and surreal; play it in another octave and it behaves and sounds quite differently.\r\r
\r\r
No matter what soft synths, sound modules, or VIs you already own, Zodiac will expand the palette of sounds in your sonic tool box and add a unique character to your music.\r\r
\r\r
The Zodiac GUI\r\r
\r\r
Despite its somewhat enigmatic appearance, Zodiac's Graphic User Interface (GUI) is quite simple to use. Here's the key:\r\r
\r\r
The Control Banks\r\r
\r\r
ON either side of the Zodiac logo is a control bank consisting of SIX levers. Under each lever is a single letter, which stand for the following:\r\r
\r\r
(Lefthand Bank)\r\r
\r\r
AMP ENV - Amp Envelope controls:\r\r
\r\r
A - Attack\r\r
D - Decay\r\r
S - Sustain\r\r
R - Release\r\r
\r\r
T - Tuning (Pitch)\r\r
R - Reverb amount\r\r
\r\r
(Righthand Bank)\r\r
\r\r
DELAY - the Delay controls:\r\r
\r\r
T - Delay Time\r\r
D - Delay Damping\r\r
P - Dealy Panning\r\r
F - Delay Feedback\r\r
\r\r
B - Bass\r\r
T - Treble\r\r
\r\r
The Levers\r\r
\r\r
Note that the four white-tipped levers on either side represent a grouping of related controls, and have a range of 0 to 10.\r\r
\r\r
Note also that the red-tipped levers represent controls not related to the white groups, and that three of these have a range from -10 to +10.\r\r
\r\r
Use command-click (MAC) or control-click (PC) to return any of the levers to the default setting of zero.\r\r
\r\r
The Reverb Window\r\r
\r\r
The window below the Zodiac logo contains a drop-down menu, with a list of fifteen very different-sounding Convolution Reverb IRs. Click on this window if you'd like to change the type of reverb on the instrument being played. Note that the R(everb) lever to the left of the window controls the amount of reverb.\r\r
\r\r
Zodiac is powered by the industry-leading Kontakt engine. It is compatible with VST, AudioUnit, AAX (Pro Tools 10) and RTAS (Pro Tools 9 & 10) plug-in formats allowing it to work seamlessly within any major sequencer, in addition to standalone use.\r\r

Handbell V2 Sampled Articulations -\r\r
\r\r
Handbell Clapper - samples are created with the traditional technique of holding it against the shoulder, bell-upwards, and then swinging the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting of the bell.\r\r
\r\r
Suspended Handbell with a soft rubber mallet - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a soft rubber mallet.\r\r
\r\r
Suspended Handbell with a hard rubber mallet - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a hard rubber mallet.\r\r
\r\r
Suspended Handbell with a plastic chopstick - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a plastic chopstick. This creates a great deal of high frequency content for a special effect.\r\r
\r\r
Singing Handbells - The Singing Handbells sound is created by running a wood dowel along the rim of the handbell, similar to the way you can run a wet finger along the edge of a crystal glass and make it sing.\r\r
\r\r
Plucked Handbells - is accomplished by using the thumb and forefinger to force the clapper head into the casting while the bell is on the table, producing a staccato note.\r\r
\r\r
Malleted Handbells on a padded table - samples are created by striking the bell with a rubber mallet while the bell is resting on the foam of a padded table. This produces a tone brighter and more percussive than the plucked samples.\r\r
\r\r
Handbell Shakes - is accomplished by quickly ringing the bell back and forth so that the clapper strikes both the front and back of the bell casting in rapid succession. This creates a continuous sustained tone.\r\r
\r\r
Martellato (mart) - this articulation is created when the handbell is rung by holding it by the handle and gently striking the full body of the handbell horizontally on the padded table.\r\r
\r\r
Martellato Lift (mart-lift) - is the above Martellato articulation followed by immediately lifting the handbell from the table to allow the bell to continue to ring."""

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO PIANO\r\r
\r\r
The vibrancy and realism of CSP make it the perfect piano accompaniment to the rest of the Cinematic Studio Series of orchestral libraries. CSP features a beautiful Yamaha C7 Grand, recorded in Australia’s premiere scoring stage. Great care went into capturing the full dynamic range of the instrument, with the pedal up and down. We also captured the incidental key and pedal noises that occur during a real performance, adding greater authenticity to the sound.\r\r
\r\r
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND REALISTIC\r\r
\r\r
Like the rest of the Cinematic Studio Series, CSP features a no-nonsense GUI, which is easy to learn so you can get straight to work. Four microphone channels, controlled via the mixer, provide the perfect combination of detail and ambience. We also included a variety of scrapes, glissandos and plucks in an FX patch, perfect for adding tension to a score. The output routing feature makes it easy to sculpt your own sound, and the modest resource footprint means you can comfortably add it to any project.\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Piano is recorded in the same world-class scoring stage as Cinematic Studio Strings, and is the perfect piano accompaniment to the rest of the series. With an integrated high quality reverb, multiple microphone positions and carefully recorded key and pedal noises, CSP’s intuitive GUI and real-life sound make it an invaluable addition to your orchestral template."""

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS\r\r
\r\r
CSS features a Hollywood-style string section, recorded in position in Australia’s premiere scoring stage – Trackdown. From the soaring colourful vibrato of the high violins to the dark and woody textures of the low cello and bass notes, you’ll be instantly inspired. Our aim was to create an instrument that’s instantly playable, sounds great out-of-the-box and is backed up by speedy customer support.\r\r
\r\r
GROUNDBREAKING INTERFACE\r\r
\r\r
At the heart of CSS is its cutting edge GUI, building on our previous critically-acclaimed library Cinematic Strings 2. This means a short-but-sweet patch list, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. These features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page, you’ll have CSS working alongside you on your latest project within minutes.\r\r
\r\r
REALISTIC AND EXPRESSIVE\r\r
\r\r
CSS features a stunningly realistic legato engine. We painstakingly recorded true legato transitions for each note, up and down, including a beautiful portamento. We also recorded ‘re-bow’ samples, meaning you can play repeated legato notes smoothly and with true-legato realism. Please check out the Legato Introduction video below. NEW: Powerful marcato articulation allows you to  create highly realistic runs with ease.\r\r
\r\r
LIVE SOUND, NO REVERB REQUIRED\r\r
\r\r
With smooth legato, punchy spiccatos, inspiring textural harmonics and con sordino, CSS covers a wide range of the sound palette afforded by a world-class string section. We’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound, so you’ll feel like you’re at a live session. With this new level of realism, you’ll feel comfortable using CSS without reverb; in fact, we recommend it! All of our demos were created without reverb – all you hear is the natural air captured in the samples.\r\r
\r\r
FULLY MIXED - LOAD AND PLAY\r\r
\r\r
We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record CSS at three distances, which you can combine to create your own unique mix either inside Kontakt or via the newly included output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our pre-mixed combination of all 3 if you want a great sound with fewer resources. Full and Lite Ensemble patches optimise workflow and are perfect for sketching or filling out a track.\r\r

NEW! CINEMATIC STUDIO WOODWINDS\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is the latest addition to the Cinematic Studio Series collection. Whether you want to blow the roof off with the bright penetrating sound of the piccolo, express emotion with the beautiful lyrical oboe, or vibrate the floor with the deep and powerful bass clarinet, these superb instruments bring warmth and vitality to your orchestral template. They perfectly complement the rest of the series: the Strings, Solo Strings, Brass and Piano.\r\r
\r\r
INTUITIVE, EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE\r\r
\r\r
At the heart of Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is its intuitive and efficient GUI. This means one patch per instrument, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. To save memory, articulations can be loaded in or out of RAM with a couple of clicks. As the layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings and Brass, these features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page.\r\r
\r\r
BROAD PALETTE — SOLOISTS AND SECTIONS\r\r
\r\r
To record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds we used a marvellous selection of top-tier players to capture the full range and character of each of nine solo instruments and four sections. Whether you want the fine detail of a soloist, or the warm collaborative synergy of our two-player sections, we recorded the full dynamic range to harness both nuance and power. Every instrument was treated equally, including the piccolo, cor anglais, alto flute, bass clarinet and contrabassoon.\r\r
\r\r
VERSATILITY AND REALISM\r\r
\r\r
CSW features a range of articulations including playful short notes, expansive textures with flutter-tongue and trills, and a stunningly realistic legato engine. We spent countless hours recording true long-form legato transitions for each note, resulting in unparalleled realism. Because we’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound you’ll feel like you’re in the room with the players. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure a delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism.\r\r
\r\r
FULLY MIXED — LOAD AND PLAY\r\r
\r\r
We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds at four mic distances: Close, Overhead, Main and Room, which you can combine to create your own mix inside Kontakt or via the output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our ready-to-go mix position that contains all four mics in a stereo mix if you want a great sound with fewer resources. A Full Ensemble patch will be released as an update in the near future.\r\r

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO BRASS\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Brass brings a powerful Hollywood-style brass section to your fingertips and is the newest addition to our Cinematic Studio Series. We spent nearly 300 hours recording in a world-class scoring stage, using a unique combination of microphones to capture the individual character and charm of each instrument. The result is a stunning package of playable, realistic brass instruments; CSB stands out from the crowd either on its own, or as a perfect complement to Cinematic Studio Strings.\r\r
\r\r
INTUITIVE SCRIPTING, EASY TO USE GUI\r\r

DETAILED SOLOISTS, POWERFUL SECTIONS\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Brass is a highly versatile library, capable of bringing you the sweet sounds of a gentle melody, or packing a real punch to bring all the drama and impact of a real Hollywood brass section to your music. We recorded the full dynamic range across every instrument, so when you play hard, you’ll hear hard – thanks to our talented players giving their all in every session. There’s nothing like hearing a brass ensemble really bring a room to life, and that’s exactly the sensation we’ve captured here.\r\r
\r\r
UNRIVALED REALISM AND CONSISTENCY\r\r
\r\r
We’ve broken new ground here with our smooth and powerful legato and marcato articulations. Long-form legato was captured across the entire dynamic range – the result of countless hours of recordings and retakes. You’ll be swept away by the level of realism we’ve achieved. In addition the legato scripting has been upgraded with further under-the-hood functionality, so sculpting new melodic phrases is easier than ever. As always, we’ve maintained the highest possible level of consistency across all instruments to give them all a similar feel on the keyboard.\r\r
\r\r
FULLY MIXED - LOAD AND PLAY\r\r
\r\r
We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record Cinematic Studio Brass at three mic distances, Close, Main and Room, which you can combine to create your own mix inside Kontakt or via the output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our ready-to-go mix position that contains all three mics in a stereo mix if you want a great sound with fewer resources. The Full Ensemble patches optimise workflow and are perfect for sketching or filling out a track.\r\r

PRESENTING CINEMATIC STUDIO SOLO STRINGS\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings is the perfect complement to Cinematic Studio Strings. CSSS brings you solo violins 1 and 2, viola and cello to add a tantalising new dimension to your musical creations. We spent more than 120 hours recording Australia’s finest string players in a world-class scoring stage, using a unique combination of microphones to capture the individual character and charm of each instrument. The result is a stunning package of playable, realistic solo strings that stands out from the crowd either on their own, as an exquisite quartet, or as first chair for the full-section strings.\r\r
\r\r
INTUITIVE, EASY TO USE GUI\r\r
\r\r
The GUI is streamlined and efficient, with a minimal number of patches making it quick and easy to learn. The layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings, so you can double the solo instrument patches with their section counterparts (eg Solo Violin I with 1st Violins), and play them at the same time on one MIDI channel. This first-chair functionality serves to reinforce the sound of each section, with the lush sound of the section bolstered by a 1st-chair solo patch. This blending together of the two libraries creates an even smoother, richer sound.\r\r
\r\r
VIRTUOSO SOLO, QUARTET OR FIRST CHAIR\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings brings all the emotional depth and virtuosity of an outstanding quartet to your fingertips, making it the perfect compositional tool for exposed lyrical solo or quartet passages. And because we maintained positional accuracy and recorded the same diverse range of articulations, CSSS provides a vibrant first-chair accompaniment to our full section library Cinematic Studio Strings. This allows you to seamlessly transition between writing for solo strings and full sections.\r\r
\r\r
UNPARALLELED REALISM\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings are expressive, emotive and powerful, with a smooth realistic sound that gives any melody that elusive human touch. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure that delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism. All of the dynamics have been preserved in their natural state, and as with CSS, no EQ or reverb was applied to the demos, so what you hear is the pure, out-of-the-box sound.\r\r
\r\r
COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ARTICULATIONS\r\r
\r\r
Cinematic Studio Solo Strings features a comprehensive list of playing articulations and styles, including true long-form legato for enhanced realism, portamentos and marcato. There is an excellent range of short notes, as well as tremolos, trills, and col legno. The articulation list, dynamic layers and keyswitch layout of the library match Cinematic Studio Strings in order to provide  a perfect first-chair accompaniment.\r\r

description = "Equinoxe is a virtual analogue synthesizer for Windows only from the English developer SuperWave based on the Ultimate synthesizer and made for recreating the works of Jean Michel Jarre. It has two oscillators, an arpeggiator, effects (delay, limiter with drive, phaser, chorus tone control and reverb) and an envelope generator with DADSR (decay-attack-decay-sustain-release). Its first oscillator can also function as the Ultimate Oscillator which has a total of 16 fully programmable oscillators which can be stereo spread, detuned and synced separately. Oscillator 1 waveforms include Ultimate Osc, Tri Sync Osc, Noise, Triangle, Sf2 Exp and Saw. Oscillator 2 waveforms are Saw, Square, Noise, Perc and Triangle. The arpeggiator of Equinoxe handles both classic and phrase arpeggiation with modes such as Down/Back, Up/Forward, Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 (note: Alt meaning 'alternative'). The sequencer of Equinoxe is a 4 X 32 step sequencer (meaning that it has got 4 32-step sequencers). In each sequence, parameters such as position and modulation parameters can be edited. The sequencer supports the playing modes Forward and Reverse. The synthesizer also has two low frequency oscillators (LFOs). Equinoxe has two filters: a state-variable filter of -12 dB/-24 dB and a Moog filter (for the creation warm, vintage sounds). The Equinoxe comes bundled with Cubase projects and MIDI files to demonstrate the features of it. The songs \"Magnetic Fields 2\" and \"Equinoxe 4\" are supplied with the demo version and 12 additional tracks are supplied with the plugin when it is purchased from the author. Additionally, the SuperWave Drums Bundle, containing the SuperWave drum modules D-808, D-909 and Tiny Pops, is also provided free of charge. The plugin comes with 192 presets including basses, leads, strings, pads and sound effects. The presets of Equinoxe include \"Oxygene 4 Lead 1\", \"Oxygene 4 Lead 2\", \"MFields 2 Lead 1\", \"FX Bird Tweets\" and \"FX Wind Fade 4\". A feature worth mentioning is that Equinoxe also comes with an initialize bank, containing preset probrams (both fxb and fxp formats) for all the waveforms, including the Ultimate Oscillator waveforms such as Ramp and Soft Ramp. This way, it is easier (also for a blind user) to change the waveform of Equinoxe from one to another. After registering the plugin, it might happen that it won't play when trying to play with the synthesizer. This occurs due to the safety features introducet with Windows. To fix this problem, the digital audio workstation (DAW) needs to be run as an administrator (or with administrator privileges). Please look for question \"Q15\" (full title: \"Q15. After installing any of the SuperWave commercial plugins, I can’t hear any sound. Is there a problem with my VST Host when running SuperWave plugins?\", currently a third level heading) for more information about the issue from the Support section of SuperWave (https://www.superwavesynths.com/support)."
accessibility_description = """
The plugin parameters can be edited with the Automation Window of the digital audio workstation (tested on REAPER 6.73 with OSARA and Psycle Modular Music Creation Studio version 1.12.0 by using its native "Parameter List" function, found under the Plugin Window (Shift+Enter) and its "View" menu). (Note: on OSARA, please press P to access the Parameter Window of a track where Equinoxe VST instrument is used in order to access the parameters of Equinoxe). The Sequencer On/Of switch and the MIDI Learn function are not accessible for a screen reader user and require sighted assistance to be executed. For example, a work-around on using the sequencer button is to make two presets (for an instance, with the REAPER or Psycle program) and to have the sighted person press the Sequencer On /Off switch and make presets so that the sequencer is turned on (preset name example: "equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_on") and where it is turned off (preset name example: "equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_off"). Then, a blind person can independently load the .fxp filesusing the load function of the VST host or digital audio workstation (DAW) (such as the "Preset menu" or "+" button in REAPER's FX Window) to load the preset to the track where Equinoxe is located in. Because of these facts stated above, the accessibility ratio (a rough estimate of the accessibility of the plugin) is about 55-65 percent. \r\r
\r\r
It is worth mentioning that a blind user should ask a registry file (with the .reg extension) to be provided by the developer via an email. The .reg file allows a blind user to register the products (including Equinoxe) independently because the registry information (i.e. license key and user ID) are stored on that file. To execute it, please press the Enter key few times. First, the Windows system should ask you if you wanted the registry changes included in the file to be stored on the registry (please answer "Yes" on this question). Finally, the Windows system should announce that the registration was successfully made so please quit the dialog with the press of the "OK" button."""

The Best M7 Simulation Ever\r\r
Made Possible With Fusion-IR\r\r
\r\r
For years the Bricasti M7 eluded all attempts to capture and reproduce the subtle beauty of this legendary hardware. Many in the industry considered it impossible.\r\r
Fusion-IR is a unique modulated convolution-based capture and reproduction technology developed specifically around the needs of M7. It redefines the rules of acoustic and workflow possibilities for convolution based reverberation processors.\r\r
\r\r
Nothing comes closer to M7 hardware than Seventh Heaven Professional.\r\r
\r\r
Now used around the world, from the smallest mountain-top backpack studios to the biggest post production facilities in London and Los Angeles, Seventh Heaven Professional is the definitive way to experience the power and beauty of M7 reverbs natively within your DAW in up to Atmos 7.1.6.\r\r
\r\r
The M7 excels in presenting the world’s most realistic simulation of rooms, spaces and plates in the most flattering of lights.\r\r
From tight, realistic interiors, chambers and studios to lush outdoor expanses, cathedrals and halls, the M7 can do it all.\r\r
Seventh Heaven Professional includes every single preset available in the Bricasti M7.\r\r
This includes all v1 and v2 firmware revision presets, including the special nonlinear reverbs and even additional interiors presets not available in hardware.\r\r
It took many months of fully automated capture to produce the thousands of Fusion-IRs needed for Seventh Heaven Professional. Only then could the true finesse of the modulated hardware be achieved via convolution. The early reflections, low frequency reverb, and late reverb were captured individually for the ultimate in control and acoustic realism.\r\r
\r\r
The Sound And Flexibility of Algorithmic Reverbs\r\r
\r\r
Treat Seventh Heaven Professional like any algorithmic reverb and forget what you’ve heard about the lifeless sound of convolution. It doesn’t apply here.\r\r
In a sampled reverb it is typically impossible to sculpt a space as required, and as is expected from users of hardware and software algorithmic reverbs. Even simple, critical tasks such as balancing the early and late reverb are impossible jobs with most convolution reverbs. Not to mention, usually any modulation is completely lost and the captures lose the organic life of the hardware.\r\r
Not so in Seventh Heaven Professional. It has the flexibility of algorithmic reverbs allowing you to perfect the acoustics of a space just as can be done on an M7 and retains the organic, lively vibe thought to be impossible to capture.\r\r
You can even use the stereo captures in surround workflows. LiquidSonics’ advanced impulse response decorrelation technology ensures excellent fold-down compatibility and the convenience of up to 7.1.6 workflows in your DAW.\r\r
Vast Editing Potential\r\r
\r\r
The Ultimate Reverb Tails\r\r
\r\r
The M7’s lush, rich decays are the star of the show. The original v1 decays are the most realistic ever heard, and the v2 exhibit stunning modulation qualities.\r\r
Every preset’s decay can be set across the M7’s full decay time range (from 200 milliseconds right up to 30 seconds).\r\r
\r\r
Delays With Added Tempo Synchronisation\r\r
\r\r
The M7’s pre-delay and multi-voice delay can be modified as freely as within the hardware itself.\r\r
Seventh Heaven Professional takes a further step by providing the ability to sync pre-delay and delay to DAW tempo.\r\r
\r\r
Reflection Pattern Selection\r\r
\r\r
Each and every modulated early reflection pattern has been captured and can be freely swapped at will. Any space can be absolutely transformed, an unprecedented feat for a sampled reverb.\r\r
Advanced Equalisation\r\r
\r\r
Precise Roll-off Filtering\r\r
\r\r
The M7’s unique roll-off curves are perfectly designed for its reverberation and reflections. Each curve (different for v1/v2 decay and early reflections) was studied and reproduced in every available position. This provides an extremely accurate reproduction of this critical component in the acoustic chain.\r\r
\r\r
5-band Post-EQ\r\r
\r\r
The M7’s early and late reverb filters have been augmented with a full 5-band parametric equaliser in Seventh Heaven Professional.\r\r
\r\r
Frequency Dependent Reverb Decay Times\r\r
\r\r
Seventh Heaven Professional also includes the ability to apply post-process low and high frequency decay time modification to the reverb.\r\r
\r\r
Ducking\r\r
\r\r
Ducking is a very powerful tool that helps you improve clarity of a reverb by tucking the wet away until a musical phrase has ended, the reverb simply floods in to fill the space rather than competing with the instrument itself."""

The unmistakable plate reverb sound – warm, rich and spacious – is now at your fingertips.\r\r
\r\r
Inspired by the original EMT 140 plate reverb, we captured the gorgeous sound and vibe of this studio classic and turned it into a fun and musically inspiring plug-in. And we couldn’t resist pushing the limits of reality, so we added a couple of fun twists that let you take Little Plate to spaces the original hardware only dreamed of.\r\r
\r\r
Simple Control, Infinite Possibilities\r\r
\r\r
Once we recreated the iconic 140 sound, we couldn’t resist going even further.\r\r
While the original reverb could only muster a modest five seconds of reverberation time, we pushed that number higher. A lot higher. With Decay Time set to infinity, Little Plate’s reverb tails never fade away. Check out these audio clips of presets that demonstrate this:\r\r
\r\r
Keep your reverb and your mixes clean with the built-in Low Cut filter.\r\r
\r\r
Sometimes the low frequency build-up in reverbs can get a little out of control. Use the Low Cut control to tame those boomy bass frequencies.\r\r
\r\r
Flip the Mod switch to introduce slight modulation into the reverb tail.\r\r
\r\r
These subtle and chaotic variations can result in a thicker and smoother sound, especially at long decay times on pitched instruments like keys, guitar, and voice.\r\r
\r\r
Heavy Vibes\r\r
\r\r
At Soundtoys, we’ve got a reputation for obsessing over legendary hardware. But when we decided to build our first reverb plug-in, we went farther than ever before. We collected five EMT 140s from around the country and gathered them in our lab.\r\r
We tuned them up. We teched them out. We went to the chiropractor (that’s one and a half tons of plate reverb). Then we took our time listening and testing, zeroing in on a sound that we think captures the classic EMT 140 vibe. Warm, rich, spacious and slightly dark, Little Plate packs the essence of plate reverb into one little plug-in that won’t break your back.\r\r
\r\r
A Little Plate History\r\r
\r\r
The EMT 140 uses a magnetic transducer to vibrate a massive sheet of metal, sending the result back to the engineer via a pickup that captures the resulting reverberation.\r\r
The EMT 140 was introduced in 1957 and was capable of dense and smooth reverberation unlike anything the world had heard. While it doesn’t exactly sound like a real room, it has a beauty of its own, which is why plate reverb is still such a sought-after sound even many decades later. 140s are getting hard to find though, and replacement parts even harder. Not to mention their sheer size and weight keep them out of reach of the average studio."""

While many other attempts at capturing factory standard Hammonds® in the past featured heavily on the Direct signal (D.I).

Both Leslies are available within the 8Dio Vintage Organ. “Analog” highlights the natural acoustics of the Hammond® Leslie and its expressive spinning states.  “Modelled” demonstrates the static, non-spinning, pure timbre of the Leslie cabinet, with a virtual rotation applied. This allows you to choose the tone and workflow that best suits you. \r

We set out to recapture trumpet and horn sections in which we maximized tone and body rather than concentrating solely on loud dynamics. You’ll notice a wider, more open sound that takes up more room in the mix at a mezzo forte dynamic. We selected articulations specifically for the creation of melodies. Our greatest influence and inspiration were the organic processes employed by the great film composers of orchestral music.

Soundscapes opens up an entirely new sonic palette of tonal and atonal sound design through granular synthesis. Full of interesting textures, it incorporates samples from violinist Michael Levine. A departure from our usual symphonic style, Soundscapes is a welcome contrast and a unique partner to our CineSymphony range.
Engine: 
The possibilities are limitless. We've created a series of patches in a few categories to give you a starting point. Try a completely different sample in one of our patches and create your own!
Categories of patches:  
• Pulses (tonal and atonal)  
• Textures (tonal and atonal)  
• One Shots  
• Pads  
Sound design:
Keep in mind that high values of some of the settings below will heavily tax your CPU. This is why some patches may not work properly on a fully loaded system.
There are 2 pages: MOTOR and FX.  
From the ENGINE page, choose your sound sample from 25 categories in the drop-down menus at the top. The sound sample is displayed in the waveform window at the top.  
• AUTO MAP forces the sample to conform to the A440 standard of your keyboard. When disabled, the sample plays as is at Middle C.  
• POSITION places the playhead at the desired starting point in the sample when you press a key.  
• SMOOTH adjusts the playhead position more smoothly.  
• VOLUME controls grain volume. Various settings can produce a wide range of output levels.  
• MOTION moves the grains. It determines the amount of movement (forward or backward) from the start position. Lower values focus on a smaller area of the sample, resulting in a smoother texture. +100% is real-time playback.  
• DENSITY determines how many grains of the sample are played per second. Higher values result in a smoother, fuller sound. *Higher DENSITY values also increase CPU usage.*  
• RAND DENSITY shuffles and randomizes the timing of each grain based on the DENSITY setting. This produces a non-quantized, more human result. Higher values prevent phasing and comb filtering.
Click TEMPO SYNC to synchronize rhythmically with your DAW. DENSITY now adjusts the number of grains per bar. For tempo sync patches to work in Kontakt standalone, the transport must be running for real-time quantization to work."""

CineSamples lifts the veil on a newcomer and it turns out to be a rather atypical instrument: a viola da gamba.
His fretted bowed instrument has 6 strings and appeared for the record for the first time in Spain in the 15th century.

Once again CineSamples has pulled out all the stops to deliver impeccable quality to this product. Recorded at the MGM studios in Los Angeles, the latter is available in Kontakt format.
Many articulations are proposed as well as a True Legato mode in order to offer the most realistic rendering possible.
The editor has gone so far as to transcribe the changes in direction of the bow and even offers the possibility of synchronizing it to the tempo of your project.
The "Infinite Bow" function will allow you to obtain a prolonged sustain which will not necessarily be natural, but which can find its full meaning on particularly slow tempi."""

These low voices recorded by CineSamples come straight from the North into your cinematic compositions in Kontakt.
Voices of War - Men of the North is a new collection for Kontakt and the free Kontakt Player, recorded at the MGM Scoring Stage in Los Angeles. For this project, CineSamples collaborated with a linguist specialized in Old Scandinavian, the language spoken by the Vikings, to obtain authentic phrases that do not resemble the pseudo-Latin used by many vocal libraries. The vocabulary is mainly drawn from themes of war, nature, and deities.
Men of the North is based on a baritone choir but with a wide enough range to span from almost diphonic (Tuva-style) singing to falsetto. The singers were arranged in a semicircle around a Neumann KU100 dummy head, which was used for recording.
The collection includes:  
• « Oo" and "Ah" monophonic legato and sustains  
• Vowel morphings  
• Whispered words  
• Growls  
• Fourths, fifths, and unison legato incantations  
• A phrase builder for constructing your own phrases  
Depending on the patch, you can select from multiple mixes (Tight, Dragonborne, Head, and Full Spectrum) and additional controls to generate drones and soundscapes. CineSamples also encourages you to make use of the modulation and expression wheels on your keyboard."""

All the controls you need in a simple interface.
Overview of 3 types of presets:  
• 808s - These are your classic 808s, heavy and rhythm-defining as you would normally expect in a library like Sub Zero 808.  
• No Kicks - Each 808 comes with a "No Kick" version which is perfect when your track already has a kick you like.  
• Clean Subs - Sometimes you just need a simple yet full sub bass, which is why we created this category. Ideal for various EDM genres.
Each preset is configured and ready for your bassline. We give you the freedom to work with these 808s however you want. Almost every patch will sustain indefinitely if you need it: just turn the sustain knob and hold the note.
Sub Zero 808 does all the work for you so you can focus on what you do best: making music. The 808s are unique and constantly evolving. The trending 808s of 2020 look nothing like what everyone aimed for in 2017. That’s why we add new presets to Sub Zero 808 for free every year."""

From John Williams to Hans Zimmer, orchestral brass has been a source of strength and power in the modern era of film music. FORZO: Heavyocity's Modern Brass was done in this image. Recorded at legendary Skywalker Sound, FORZO is the product of Heavyocity's world-class sound design team, in collaboration with award-winning composer Jason Graves and Hollywood sound engineer Satoshi Mark Noguchi. This dream team entered the hallowed halls of Skywalker with one goal in mind: to create a new benchmark for orchestral brass.
To bring this monster to life, FORZO first assembled an epic ensemble of world-class horns. The 12 horns, four trumpets, eight trombones (tenor, bass and double bass) and two tubas deliver 25 GB of pure copper power straight into the hands of the cinematic composer. Creative articulations like Cluster Bends and Random Flutters give muscular sections in a very unique way. And if you really want to master those explosive Brass VIs, the FORZO Full Ensemble NKI puts the entire 26-piece brass orchestra (playing at the same time, in the same room) at your fingertips. You've heard brass, but not like this. FORZO: Modern Brass is truly beyond the ordinary.
While FORZO's Organic Brass is best in class, the instrument's 300+ presets wouldn't be complete without a diverse collection of hybrid cinematic content and tempo-synced loops. Once again, Heavyocity has taken a collection of meticulously recorded samples and created something totally new: FORZO's hybrid side blazes a new trail for the modern composer, as creative processing and expert sound design crosses the line. fine line between organic and electronic.
The new Heavyocity Forzo Modern Brass features 11,475 sound samples compiled into 9 NKI instrument presets. For this, the team called on composer Jason Graves (Tomb Raider, Dead Space, Far Cry Primal) and sound engineer specializing in film music, Satoshi Mark Noguchi (Midnight Special, Lone Survivor), while this beautiful world having found itself at Skywalker Sound (where the soundtracks of The Fountain, Dead Space 2, Gears of War were recorded).
You are thus entitled to the traditional French horns, trumpets, tenor/bass/double bass trombones, tubas, with hundreds of articulations available, but also to a set of 26 instruments and two design tools: the Hybrid Brass Designer and the Brass Loop Designer, the first offering an approach that combines music and sound design and allows you to combine sounds, while the second offers more than 400 tempo-synchronized brass loops that you can assign to different parts of your keyboard."""

The Fredonia Grand Organ puts the power and majesty of a full pipe organ at your fingertips with unmatched depth and range.
39 stops that can be combined for an infinite number of possible tones.
Featuring one of the biggest sounds you have ever used, easily adjustable from a delicate scale to an almost cosmic one.
To create the Fredonia Grand Organ, we sampled the magnificent Schlicker pipe organ at SUNY Fredonia. Every pipe organ has a unique voice, and this one has an especially powerful sound with incredible versatility.
Capturing the nuances and fullness of a pipe organ is no small feat, but such a grand instrument deserves special attention. We reproduced many features of a real organ, including crescendo and swell controls, so that it sounds like the real thing. Its 2,469 pipes were deeply sampled with four mic positions and four divisions (Swell, Positive, Pedal, and Great).
We sampled each stop - a total of 39 - individually to give you full control over the sound. Combine any or all of them to customize the tone as you wish.
In addition, we emulated the behavior of the instrument's six couplers, so you can add or subtract octaves at the press of a button.
And if you are looking for a brilliant sound right out of the box, we have provided a range of powerful presets with different combinations of stops and signal chains in our Console FX rack and mixer.
From the delicate rohrflöte to the earth-shaking thunder of the full instrument in chorus, the Fredonia Grand Organ will take your breath away."""

CREMONA QUARTET is a collection of four precious string instruments dating back to the 17th century, capturing and preserving every detail of these rare instruments.
Stradivari may be the most famous luthier in history, but many of the greatest musicians and composers on the planet consider Guarneri del Gesù to be the finest. The second violin of this quartet is his ‘Prince Doria’, built in 1734.
Each articulation of every note was recorded using a custom collection of microphones placed in a purpose-built acoustic environment in the Auditorium Giovanni Arvedi. Even the citizens of Cremona contributed, with all road traffic near the auditorium stopped during the recording sessions.
e-instruments, the creator of SESSION STRINGS and SESSION HORNS, specializes in designing particularly detailed sampled instruments. They initiated the CREMONA QUARTET project to digitally preserve these rare and extraordinary sounds so that today’s and tomorrow’s musicians and composers can use them in their contemporary productions.

KINETIC METAL is your passport to uncharted sonic territory. Spin and transform a library of alternative metals into sound beds, shifting textures, and delicate tonal percussion. Spin both wheels and enter an audio universe found on no map.
The roughly 200 unique multi-layered instruments of KINETIC METAL come from a wide palette of uncommon metal sources. Each instrument combines four samples with four synthetic waveforms and arranges them into four distinct “personalities.”
The Forge wheel morphs continuously between them. Each position of the wheel provides a unique texture for intuitive, responsive, and completely fun sound design.
The FX wheel of KINETIC METAL lets you dive into new audio depth. Just like the Forge wheel, the FX wheel consists of four main parameters. Use them as a starting point for your journey through near-limitless variations of each instrument’s sound.
In addition, eight effect sliders let you take these effects into the creative stratosphere by shaping the sound to your taste. Put KINETIC METAL into orbit with the Motion button. When engaged, the MOTION function automatically spins either the Forge or FX wheel for a dynamically evolving sound.
Let one wheel spin while you manually control the other for stunning results. Or link both wheels and listen as KINETIC METAL creates its own dramatic shifts of intense textures.
KINETIC METAL was designed by renowned sound designer Jeremiah Savage. For over a year, Jeremiah recorded an enormous stock of alternative samples. He then hand-selected the very best sounds to create the more than 200 multi-layered instruments that make up KINETIC METAL."""

EVOCATIVE CONCERT GRAND
Experience the characteristic grand piano sound of composer and pianist Nils Frahm. It's the sound of a concert piano unique in the world - chosen by the artist himself, custom-tuned and augmented with a felt mute. We captured the piano in its natural habitat - the Saal 3 of Berlin's famous Bauhaus-designed Funkhaus recording complex. The result is a unique, intense and evocative instrument, with a very personal atmosphere.
With NOIRE, it's not about mimicking a particular sound - it's about creating your own sonic signature using inspiring raw material with plenty of creative options. Incorporate noises for more realism, choose from different sound design options, add subbasses and experiment! You can then fine-tune the location of the piano in the mix by applying EQ, compression, reverb and delay.
This unique, custom-tuned 9ft (2.74m) Yamaha CFX grand piano was methodically (and lovingly) sampled by Uli Baronowsky and Galaxy Instruments. Using vintage microphones and preamps, the team spent several weeks capturing the full tonal range and dynamics of this special instrument in Saal 3 of Berlin's legendary Funkhaus Nalepastrasse - once the headquarters of national radio. East German. Uli and Galaxy Instruments previously created UNA CORDA, THRILL, THE DEFINITIVE PIANO COLLECTION, RISE & HIT and THE GIANT in partnership with Native Instruments.
• Nils Frahm's concert piano, meticulously sampled in a legendary hall
• Includes raw piano sound and a muffled version, each with extensive customization options

It was sampled in two velocity layers with four round robins each for chromatic metal keys, sizzler, and release samples. The instrument was close-mic’d in stereo. The key range is B1 to C5.
The library includes:

COLOURS: Adaptive Runs is a library of orchestral runs that covers strings, woodwinds, and brass.
It is powered by the Adaptive Sync engine, which automatically aligns the orchestral runs to the host tempo, the next downbeat, or a custom setting in beats or seconds.
You may load only the sections you need (strings, woodwinds, brass), choose run direction (ascending/descending), set the range (intervals up to multiple octaves), and use the “Bounce” feature to loop runs up and down.
It provides multiple microphone positions (Close, Stage, Far, Wide, plus a cinematic pre-mixed mix) and a set of combo and individual instrument patches (violins, woodwinds, brass, etc.).
The interface offers controls for sync mode, envelopes, reverb amount, EQ, stereo width, and mic output routing.
Runs were recorded in 24-bit / 48 kHz in the same concert hall used by other ProjectSAM libraries, ensuring sonic consistency across the series.

• Up to 60 seconds of sustain.
About the Yamaha Electric Grand CP-80.
Yamaha CP-80 was manufactured by Yamaha Corporation in 1976. Musicians who love rock, progressive rock, fusion, jazz, funk and various other styles love the characteristic warm piano sound of the CP-80. This electric piano is considered among the top in standards and is a (must-have) musical instrument. A huge number of albums and musicians feature the CP-80 on their productions, including George Duke, Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers, Eddie Jobson in UK, and Peter Gabriel in Genesis. They love its characteristically unique, sharp attack piano sound. Adding a chorusing effect or blending this piano’s timbre into a mix of acoustic and electric instruments adds a luscious sound to any project. The production possibilities are endless. When you touch a key of CP-80, the inside hammer strikes directly at the internal tension string, and pickup microphones installed near the strings receive the sound, one for each key. CP-80 looks cool and has an excellent sound, but it is hard to maintain and keep in good condition due to its mechanical structure, tuning sensitivity, and weight. Prominy ELECTRIC GRAND PCP-80 addresses these difficulties by letting you play the CP-80 sound anytime on a computer, suitable for a wide range of genres and especially highlighting music from the 1970s through the 1980s."""

• Legato note transitions (slides up or down). Trigger these on certain notes for a more authentic banjo performance, since banjo players rarely pick every note when playing rolls.
• Legato triggered manually or with the Auto-Legato feature. If two consecutive notes are either a half step or whole step apart, a banjo player would normally slide rather than pick; Auto-Legato does this automatically.
• Fret position for open strings (no capo, which is most common) or any fret position up the neck. Cletus moves his hand up the fretboard to confirm the position.
• Animated GUI.
• NKS compatible.
• What’s new
• Twice as many patterns."""

The concept for our first Palette Brush pack (Melodics) is simple. We studied the scores of several of our favorite classical and modern film music composers and selected 18 of the most evocative melody-carrying combinations and instruments. We recorded a soaring violin section playing octaves, regal trumpets with horns, playful flutes & piccolo, creepy bass clarinet & contrabassoon octaves, a gigantic and downright frightening low strings & low brass ensemble and many others. We felt it was also important to include soloists since they are so often used to deliver a melody, so we recorded 6 of those as well. 17 of the 18 instruments in the library have true legato.
As with the entire Palette line, our players were recorded in standard orchestral seating position with 3 microphone perspectives - Close, Decca Tree and Hall. The room is spacious but fairly dry, which allows for easy blending with other libraries using your favorite reverbs so you’re not limited to the sound of one particular hall.

Sample Logic and System Blue are proud to announce Fanfare, a revolutionary Kontakt Player virtual instrument that combines the brass of the Blue Devils, DCI world champions, with Sample Logic’s award-winning sound design.
From traditional marching brass to cinematic soundscapes, Fanfare offers a marching brass library for educators and arrangers, as well as an extraordinarily versatile and inspiring set of construction tools for film, television, and game composers, producers, and electronic musicians.
Inspired by the spirit of John Meehan, lead brass and wind arranger, Fanfare features a wide range of samples recorded by Leslie Ann Jones on the scoring stage at Skywalker Sound (a Lucasfilm Ltd company) and on the field at Ralph Wilson Stadium (home of the Buffalo Bills) by Grammy-award-winning engineer Frank Dorritie.
The indoor sessions were captured with close, mid, and far microphone placements, while the outdoor sessions used state-of-the-art stadium surround recording techniques.
The resulting sound textures range from stadium ambience to an 85-piece “in-your-face” brass ensemble, with all recordings capturing the signature sound of the Blue Devils, featuring strikingly inventive chords, avant-garde clusters, swells, and organic brass effects.
Fanfare not only delivers the finest traditional marching brass samples available but also expands the sonic scope of the library with Sample Logic’s programming techniques that “blur the line between music and sound design.”
Starting from traditional brass recordings, a complete multi-sampled “cinematic” instrument library has been created, offering not only world-class brass at your fingertips but also an inspiring collection of melodies, pads, leads, stingers, impacts, transitions, atmospheres, and articulated rhythms — all organized into easily accessible, production-ready presets.
INSTRUMENTS & MULTIS
A complete collection of traditional brass (trumpets, mellophones, euphoniums, tubas, and trombones) recorded with multiple round robins, multiple dynamics, and up to five microphone positions.

• Atmospheric/ambient soundscapes and stinger construction kits
Rhythmic instrument arpeggiator/arp-gator

Features
Thomas Skarbye set out to capture the sounds of a single instrument in a level of detail previously unheard of for sample users. Based on careful study and detailed restoration and preparation of the instrument, he set out to capture its soul and strike a balance between sound quality, playability and post-editing - a perfect combination of state-of-the-art sampling technologies.
The SCARBEE MARK I is derived from Scarbee's legendary "Classic Electric Piano".
The Mark I is renowned for its expressiveness and dynamics.
The Scarbee team had to provide meticulous work to succeed in capturing an authentic sound and feeling. Each of the 73 keys was sampled with 12 different velocities. To complete the realism of the instrument, the release sounds (created by the dampers as they bounce against the tine when the key is released) have been recorded for each of the 12 velocities at exactly the same levels as the 12 samples of corresponding sustain. The option to add natural instrument noise (adjustable level) and the built-in effects section allow for even more sensational results.
Effects included:
reverb, chorus, phaser, amp simulation, distortion, auto-wah, panning, compression, delay and bass/treble correction.

• Built-in effects and adjustable noise level
• Individual output samples for each of the 12 velocities"""

Simple assignment of sound shaping parameters to any MIDI sliders, knobs or controllers makes designing completely unique performable textures easy and quick.
The sound world of AURAS focuses primarily on abstract and impressionistic textures and rhythms, influenced by artists who blur the boundaries between sound design, orchestration and music. A wide variety of sounds were recorded as material for the sound design, with an emphasis on capturing performance and movement.
AURAS + COLOURS: the AURAS section contains over 60 curated multi-layered instruments, creatively programmed to inspire new ideas. With over 100 patches, the COLOURS environment lets you take the source material from the AURAS instruments and shape your own sounds, with a built-in modulation matrix controllable via MIDI controllers, MPE multi-touch controls, or two internal LFOs.

CYCLES is an innovative and powerful loop manipulation and granular synthesis environment. Through a variety of idiosyncratic and interactive processes it pulls apart and reconstructs audio into collaged loops, performable textures, modulating rhythms, generative sequences, and playable pads.
• LOOPS: an audio looper, splicer, and synthesiser. An interactive visual timeline slices loops into rhythmic segments and re-collages them into new, irregular formations. Playback parameters enable detailed loop manipulation, while parameter modulation and slice randomisation create further rhythmic evolution.
• GRAINS: operates at the micro level, deconstructing loops into tiny fragments and rebuilding them into diffuse, amorphous clouds of texture. Variable grains interact to create generative soundscapes and gestural movements, with physically simulated modulation introducing natural repetition by animating parameters in cyclical patterns.
• Library: over 450 loop sources divided into six packs (Machine Drums, Modular, Analogue, Frets, Metallophones, Bowed). Use loops straight out of the box or as source material to be reshaped inside the engine.
• Preset engine states: 100 preset states transform the engine into different sets of parameters, settings, and modulation, producing a wide palette of unique processed loops and textures from energetic pulses and plucks to rich cinematic ambiences.
• Presets: over 150 pads, textures, and sequences created by transfiguring a single source loop within the engine, performable with dynamic modulation via the mod wheel.
• Import: drag and drop a sample anywhere on the interface to load it into LOOPS and GRAINS. Load up to 25 loops or samples simultaneously per instrument; user patches can be saved within the CYCLES file structure for access via the library tab.
• Workflow: cartesian grid sequencer, XY, modulation, macros, performance. Sequence steps appear on a two-dimensional grid and are moved through using non-linear patterns; pitch is quantised to scales; grid values can be reconfigured, adopted from preset patterns, or randomised for continuous exploration of abstract melodic and rhythmic ideas."""

LANDFORMS offers a bold new approach to working with orchestral samples. Part sampler, part synthesiser, it takes textural recordings inspired by the movements and shapes of nature and reimagines them within a multidimensional sound design environment.
• More than an orchestral library: LANDFORMS is a complex orchestral sound design environment. The focus is not only on the performance of beautiful acoustic textures but on pushing them through unique processing to create constantly shifting, abstract collages of sound.
• Emerging from nature: articulations were curated with specific compositional intentions, fusing rhythmically and overlapping unpredictably to create progressive textural evolutions.
• Orchestral content: over 200 core multisampled articulations across the families of the orchestra. Strings are presented as trios of bass, cello, and violin. Woodwinds include a low ensemble (baritone saxophone, contrabassoon, bass clarinet), a high ensemble (oboe, clarinet, bassoon), and a trio of flutes. Brass comprises a low trombone section and a high ensemble of trumpet and flugelhorn. Additional articulations from solo violinist and flautist sessions are included.
• Recorded at Real World Studios: the Wood Room’s warm acoustics captured via hyper-focused spots and room mics to create a full-spectrum dynamic mix with deep tonal range.
• Presets: over 400 sound-designed patches, from distorted percussive pulses to obscure electroacoustic textures.
• Expanded sources: 50 processed sound sources built from the orchestral recordings using eurorack modules, granular engines, cassette machines, pedal chains, and amplifiers.
• Engine: spatial mixer for two-dimensional mic positioning plus modules, effects, layers, and expression controls.
• Import: drag and drop your own samples, load up to twelve at once, and transform them within the engine."""

description = """
A Tingklik is a bamboo percussion instrument from Bali. It is often used for (Rindik) music, and is sometimes referred to as a Rindik itself. Rindik music usually involves two Tingklik players and a single Suling (bamboo flute).
A Tingklik typically has 11 bamboo tubes, although the instrument we sampled has 12. With five notes per octave, the range is just over 2 octaves. The tubes are suspended using string over a wooden frame. The player sits on the ground and strikes the bamboo tubes with rubber-tipped mallets.
The Tingklik player uses both hands, bouncing the mallets in a constant rhythm. The left hand usually plays the melody and the right hand plays an accompaniment. If there are two players, the right hand parts are often interlocking (a technique called kotekan), giving an illusion of extremely fast playing.
Each note was sampled at 12 different velocity levels, with 6 alternate samples for each level, ensuring a very natural, living sound. The instrument includes tools for doubling the Tingklik to simulate authentic paired playing. Both the original tuning and a full chromatic western tuning are included.

French musician Jean-Philippe Rykiel contacted us about a unique type of African balafon in which each key had snares that vibrated when played, giving it a interesting buzzing quality.
Usually found in parts of northern Ghana, Burkina Faso, and south-eastern Mali. Hardwood keys are suspended over calabash gourds. Silk or paper covers small holes in the gourds which resonates to produce the characteristic buzzing.
Rykiel has long been involved with West African musicians, having collaborated with both Salif Keita and Youssou N’Dour. For the balafon however, he knew of a virtuoso player from Burkina Faso named Mamadou Diabate now living in Austria. He enlisted Mamadou to play the instrument for a recording session that he would conduct himself.
The recordings then made their way to us, and the result is the instrument you find here. We hope you’ll find this instrument both curious and inspirational.

With Grosso, Sonokinetic BV is changing the paradigm for orchestral phrase-based instruments. Before Minimal, the level of control, whilst retaining the authentic sound of live recordings, was unheard of. We received so much positive feedback on Minimal that a sequel was unavoidable.
We conceived this instrument from the ground up, using parts of the Minimal engine and reimagining many other elements to accommodate the added flexibility Grosso brings. The main difference, apart from the upbeat nature of the recorded material and the addition of a choir and a taiko plus non-melodic percussion section, is that we split the orchestral sections.
• Strings and choir split into low, mid, high
• Woodwinds and brass split into low and high
• Percussion split into taiko and traditional orchestral percussion
All these elements were carefully composed to work well with the others, resulting in millions of possible combinations.
Grosso is a 12/8 feel library and the engine works in both 4/4 and 12/8 within your DAW. Though conceived with trailer and action styles in mind, the finished product is capable of much more.
A Transition Builder instrument glues parts together and builds towards climaxes, including brass and woodwind crescendo chords that recognize chord types, plus percussion fills and a fully playable multisampled taiko ensemble.
Version 2.0 new features:
• Sample offset controls
• Phrase picker previews
• Release sample volume adjustment
• Dedicated patches for Komplete Kontrol
• MIDI drag and drop from the score view
Supplied patches include strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, choir, and a Dynamic Builder tool. Time stretching and tempo syncing use Time Machine Pro 2 and Sonokinetic’s Intelligent Tempo Mapping.
Sampled forces:
• 52 strings: violins, violas, celli, basses

The ropes that suit you\r
This product is the\r
culmination of all our efforts so far. It combines our experience with\r
orchestral phrases with what we've learned over the years about multisampling,\r
and it continues our quest for total phrase flexibility.\r
At its core, Orchestral\r
Strings is an extremely capable full-divisi string section, recorded with the\r
fantastic Capellen Orchestra in Zlin, Czech Republic, and edited with great\r
care to preserve every performance detail.\r
We've covered all the most\r
commonly used articulations, with up to four velocities, and we've designed a\r
'common tail' system for short strings, which allows you to have more round\r
robins without increasing the memory load too much.\r
Poly-Legato and Auto\r
Divisi guarantee the most realistic sound. We still have a few more surprises\r
up our sleeves that will improve your user experience and provide you with\r
tools that are both useful and fun.\r
The instrument includes\r
powerful midi engines, with midi import, realtime midi manipulation, note\r
editor and midi export. The possibilities are almost endless, but very easily\r
accessible if you just want to scratch the surface.\r
The Runs Engine allows you\r
to play chords and trigger runs that adhere to those chords by simply playing a\r
start key and an end key.\r

• Instrument 2. Poiesis Cello Articulation Keyswitch allows you to organise single articulations in a completely customisable switching system using traditional key switching or velocity-based switching.
The sound. Poiesis Cello was recorded in a dry studio with three high-end microphones placed relatively close to the instrument to offer an intimate sound. The microphones used are a Neumann U87 (LDC), an AEA R84A (RBN) and a Schoeps CMC/mk4 (SDC). A pre-rendered stereo MIX with the single microphones in LCR position and additional processing is also included.

The patches. Poiesis Cello features two different patches.
• Textures is a two-layer instrument that allows you to choose between any of the 43 included articulations for each of the layers and freely crossfade between them using the mod-wheel.
• Shorts is a complementary patch that features three velocity-sensitive short articulations sampled with 5 round robins and 3 dynamic layers (pizzicato triggers Bartok pizz at velocity 127)."""

Alpha Organ features a beautifully sampled pair of pipe organs recorded individually and together at St. Paul’s Church in San Francisco, CA. Each organ offers a distinct contrast to the other and when the two are played simultaneously in unison, the sound is glorious. We’ve captured both instruments individually and together in unison, with multiple microphone types and positions to offer you a variety of aesthetic options.
The (lower) organ, built by Kilgen Church Organ Company of Saint Louis, MO, was originally water-powered, but has since been converted to an electric blower-driven system. The console is in the south isle near the side entrance and its pipes are hidden behind the altar with the blower and machinery under the floor of the Apse, allowing the lowest pedal notes to resonate through the floor, seeming to shake the very foundation.
The upper organ, far larger and more elaborate, was built by the Felix F. Shoenstein & Sons Organ company of San Francisco. It is arrayed high above the portcullis and Narthex in a mezzanine between the two bell towers. Where the first organ (our Alpha Organ) is sweet and silky in its tone, the second (our Omega Organ) is thunderous and mighty in its body and energy, with a more powerful blower, larger console and many more pipes.
We feel that this space has extraordinary acoustic properties bordering on the mystical. Each time we’ve recorded there, we’ve experienced waves of strange synchronicities. The entire hall seems to sing as if one great living instrument. To honor the high strangeness that the space seems to evoke, we’ve enriched this library with a very wide selection of sound designed ambiences, leads, pads, drones and custom effect presets, delving deeply into psychoacoustic and metaphysical aesthetics.
The church was built by its own perishoners over a period of two decades, starting in 1897, delayed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and finally completed in 1911, using stone salvaged from the ruined city itself. It has a lush, pristine quality full of spacious airiness and crystal clarity, without a hint of cloudiness or oversaturation.
This reverberant hall is one of our very favorite recording locations, home to our acclaimed Requiem Light Symphonic Choir, the Native Instruments Symphony Series Brass Ensemble and Solo collections and many other classic Soundiron libraries.
We’ve packed the user interface with powerful sound-shaping controls to give you complete flexibility. Controls for volume swell, attack and release time, sample start offset, vibrato, and sound bank selection are included in all presets. The main preset also features a microphone mixer and an octave effect. The Layered preset includes 4 independent sound layers, each with a full set of parameters that can be linked, automated and customized.
The first three layers are the Close (Mic 1), Mid (Mic 2) and Far (Mic 3) microphone positions. The fourth layer is the Ambiences layer. We used various sound-design tricks to morph the sounds from our journey into 30 different tonal and dissonant pads, synth-tones and ambient dreamscapes. They can be played by themselves, or used to add texture and body to the primary sounds.
In the advanced settings pull-down window, you’ll also find an adaptable per-layer LFO system, with selectable LFO shape, modulation target parameter, speed, intensity, tempo-syncing and fade-in time. You can also apply your choice of 13 lowpass, high-pass and FX filters, with assignable modulation targets such as velocity, mod-wheel, expression, after-touch, key position and step-sequencer table control.
Our customizable arpeggiator features a built-in velocity sequencer table and control over arp direction, note timing, swing, randomization and duration. The built-in modular FX rack window offers 27 different DSP effect modules that you can assign in any of 8 available slots, in any order that you wish. The Reverb effect includes 99 of our own convolution reverb impulse presets. We’ve captured a huge variety of different rooms, halls, chambers and outdoor environments, along with 139 unique, strange and creative special effect impulses to completely transform the sound and open up whole new worlds of musical possibility."""

This instrument features a flexible GUI and all libraries from the Antidrum series as well as Cathedral of Junk, Luftballoon, Luminabells, PVC Beatbox Ensemble, and Snow Drums.
Antidrum Machine is the ultimate compendium of alternative instruments, experimental percussive sounds, toys, junk, machines, tools, surfaces and objects and all kinds of other uniquely musical and acoustically interesting sonic sources. This vibrant palette of musical inspiration contains a vast collection of (found-sounds), field recordings, prepared objects, surfaces, machines and noisy contraptions, booming bass to tight clicks, clacks, zips, zings, ticks and tocks.
Antidrum Machine includes all of the content from Antidrum 1, Antidrum 2, and Antidrum 3 as well as Cathedral of Junk, Luftballoon, Luminabells, PVC Beatbox Ensemble, and Snow Drums. We have also created a vast new volume of toys, instruments and sound sources exclusively for this compendium.
Antidrum Machine has been built for Kontakt Player and Komplete Kontrol platforms, including full support for Maschine and all S-Series keyboards.
This library contains 3 different preset types that allow users to interact with the content in different ways. The Dual Layer preset type allows every articulation to be played tuned spread across the key range exposing the sonic qualities of all the sounds. There are two fully configurable layers in this preset type, each with sound selection, LFO, filter and sound shaping controls: volume, attack, offset, release, bass, treble, pitch and panning.
The Single Effects preset type gives users access to all the special single-shot effects that did not fit into any velocity or round-robin based articulation. Each Single Effects preset has the same sound controls as each layer in the Dual Layer presets. The Ensemble preset types spread all the articulations across the available key range. LFO, filter, and sound shaping controls are available, as well as mapping customization.
Users can remap any articulation to any key, and we include a Random button to let users explore how a midi beat changes when randomly selected percussive sounds are assigned to the keys.
Every preset type includes our integrated ARP arpeggiator system, featuring a suite of options like rhythm, direction, swing and randomization. The easy Glide feature is also included, instantly turning sustaining content into a monophonic legato or portamento instrument with adjustable pitch bend speed control, and adds an adjustable pitch bend to percussive content.
All LFOs are configurable with user-selectable shape and modulation target parameter, as well as free or tempo-synced speed, depth and attack. Every Filter is powerful, letting users select from 12 different filter types and modulation options such as sustain pedal and step sequencer.
• Powerful Custom User Interface with CC and host automation support for all major DAWs and Komplete Kontrol hardware and software.
• Each layer has its own primary controls for Volume, Attack, Release, Offset, Pitch, Pan, Modulation routing and Filter settings.
• Try the Map window Randomize button in the Ensemble presets to instantly generate new ensemble mappings for inspiration on the fly.
• FX Rack with 18 effect modules, configurable controls and customizable routing and chain saving or loading.

description = """
Bentside Spinet derives from spinetta, a word used for all quilled instruments in 17th-century Italian. The spinet was a preferred household keyboard since it took up less room than the harpsichord, produced a dark and quiet tone, and was aesthetically stunning. As one of the precursors of the pianoforte, the oldest artifact is dated 1490, but started to gain popularity around 1631.
By the 18th century, bentside spinets were found all over Europe and were used for daily home entertainment and musical instruction. The instrument shape resembled a harp laid horizontally, with the keys in the position of the sounding-board. As a result, the spinet produced a rich and sustained timbre, but darker and less brilliant than the harpsichord. It had a five octave range with natural keys re-covered with ebony and ivory topped accidentals, giving it a strikingly memorable look.
We recorded each key of Bentside Spinet in stereo close and far mic positions with 8 round robin, as well as note releases and key sound effects. Then we rounded out the natural tone of this baroque keyboard with 20 ambient soundscapes and 20 custom FX presets to launch your musical time machine right into a European parlor.
The Kontakt interface includes a suite of automation-ready sound-shaping controls to give you total creative flexibility. You have control over swell, attack, release, offset, vibrato, filter, pitch (coarse and fine), articulation switching, cross-fading and layering, and more.
This library comes with an adaptable LFO system, with selectable LFO shape, modulation target parameter, speed, intensity, tempo-syncing and fade-in time. You can also apply your choice of 12 lowpass, high-pass and FX filters, with assignable modulation targets such as velocity, modwheel, expression, after-touch, key position and step-sequencer table control. Our customizable arpeggiator offers a velocity table and control over arp direction, timing, swing, randomization and duration.
We’ve included a key and scale lock system to constrain your notes to common scales and keys for easy melodic composition and live performance.
The interface is rounded-out by our modular FX rack panel, with 18 different DSP effect modules that you can assign in any of 10 available slots, in any order that you wish. You’ll find classic phaser, flanger, delay, distortion, amp and cab simulators, compressors, EQ, rotator and much more.
The Reverb effect includes our favorite convolution reverb impulse responses, including 99 different rooms, halls, chambers and outdoor environments, plus another 40 custom FX impulses to radically transform the sound and open up whole new worlds of musical possibility.

We hand-crafted 11 GB of sound content with over 1,800 samples. The preset browser tree makes exploration and creation easy, with everything organized into a practical range of musical, textural, and aesthetic categories that are useful and easy to search.

Tines & Echoes is a unique tuned percussion created by Bart Hopkin. It is a pentagonal sound box with 25 chromatically tuned metal tines, each paired with a set of sympathetic strings spanning the sound board. The sympathetic strings are tuned randomly rather than to their primary tines, so vibrations excite different string combinations bound to other tines. When the tines are plucked, they produce a sharp, crisp water-drop note that spreads through the sympathetic strings in a soft, ghostly ring.
We sampled tine plucks and percussive hand slaps on the body with two stereo mic positions. A wide selection of custom FX presets and sound-designed ambient and cinematic content crafted from the raw source gives complete creative freedom.
• 25 chromatic plucked notes with two microphone positions
• Percussive knock effects

Waterharp is a deeply-sampled bowed and tuned percussion and special FX library that captures the resonant waterphone, originally developed by Richard Waters. It also offers a wide selection of creative presets, ambiences and sound-designed pads, with an intuitive GUI for Kontakt.
We played it with many different mallets, sticks, metal rods, fingers, palms, bows and even voices to explore every nuance and hidden musical potential of this instrument. We recorded it both empty and full of water. We even recorded it from the inside out using hydrophones, while heated over open flame and filled with machine screws. Finally, we created a wide selection of ambient soundscapes, pads, drones, ambiences and atmospheres using the recordings and all manner of creative sound design techniques.
Contents include:
• Bowing (no water) — Slow, Medium, Fast FX
• Bowing sweep (water) — Slow, Medium, Fast FX
• 2-note legato bowing
• Bowing Sustain (with and without water)
• Bowing Staccato
• Bowing FX: grinding / tine buzz (with/without water)

\r
BML Mural Symphonic\r
Strings features 60 of London's finest instrumentalists.\r
Recorded in the Lyndhurst\r
lounge at Air Studios from five microphone stations.\r
Excellent performance,\r
sound and ambience.\r
Mural is available in\r
several distinct volumes:\r
The first contains\r
essential articulations (including real legato samples).\r
The second adds more\r
fundamental styles such as trills, effects, and Legato slides.\r
The additional legato\r
articulations in volume 2 will not work if you don't already have volume 1.\r
Both volumes require the\r
full version of Native Instruments Kontakt 5, and will not work on the free\r
Kontakt Player or any other sampler format.\r
Since their recording\r
conditions and layout are identical, you can mix and match patches from the\r
first two volumes: this is explored in Volume 2 as combo patches incorporating\r
samples from both libraries.\r
Continuing Spitfire\r
Audio's tradition, the channel sets were recorded from multiple microphone\r
positions via an analog tape signal path in Air Studios' Lyndhurst room.\r
Unlike Spitfire's Albion\r
series strings (which feature octave and unison sets, Mural's sections have\r
been recorded in separate, united groups, allowing you to make your own\r
decisions about orchestration and doubling. 'octave.\r
The section sizes\r
correspond to those used in a full symphony orchestra:\r
 16 first violins, 14\r
second violins (a completely different set of players),\r
 12 violins, 10 violins\r
and eight basses, which represents 60 musicians.\r
Features :\r
Wall volume 1\r
The dozen or so\r
articulations played by the string sections of Volume 1 cover familiar\r
territory, but one exception is the 'sul ponticello' style: the thin, icy\r
timbre has a slightly menacing atmosphere, and played by the basses it takes on\r
a sort of muted arctic grandeur.\r
A more conventional sense\r
of menace is conveyed by tremolos, especially when you start quietly and slowly\r
increase their volume.\r
Looping vibration and\r
non-vibration, vibration and non-vibration ("longs" in Spitfire\r
parlance) play with and without mutations, and both options are lush and\r
expansive.\r
Along the same lines, the\r
floating "flautando" tone supports the soft tone, which is\r
particularly attractive in the low register.\r
This style of play is\r
difficult to control in real life, and therefore benefits from being sampled\r
and tamed!\r
Like all contemporary orchestral\r
libraries, Mural features dynamic modulated dynamic modeling for its long\r
notes.\r
Interval-based legato\r
sampling is a highlight: "fingered legacy" legume patches, in which\r
both violin sections produce upbeat and vivacious performances, violin players\r
warn of wind and strings basses combine strength, elegance and lyricism.\r
Low :\r
Tuning the cellos and\r
basses in octaves gives the classic and instantly recognizable sound of bass\r
orchestration, very effective for sustains, legatos and spiccatos.\r
Patches called Time\r
Machine Short Notes use Kontakt's time-stretching algorithm to artificially\r
alter the length of spiccatos, pizzicatos, and col legno samples via a\r
Stretch fader on the GUI.\r
This would be useful if\r
you need exaggeratedly short spiccato notes or an ultra-short pizzicato cutoff.\r
The articulations of the\r
first Mural bank are:\r
 Longs nonvib\r
 Longs vib\r
 Legato Fingered\r
 Longs Con Sordino nonvib\r
 Longs Con Sordino vib\r
 Longs Harmonics\r
 Longs Flautando\r
 Longs Tremolando\r
 Longs Sul Ponticello\r
 Spiccato\r
 Pizz\r
 Bartok Pizz\r
 Col Legno\r
In summary :\r
Size is a factor in the\r
orchestral world, and the large sections and spacious sound of Mural Symphonic\r
Strings' Air Lyndhurst Hall are on par with big-screen film music.\r
Together, these two\r
volumes provide a wide variety of very usable performance (including true\r
legato), the recording quality is fabulous, and the multiple microphone\r
positions make surround mixing a breeze."""

This bank allows you to\r
use 3 banks in one, these are the Arva, Freya and Wotan banks:\r
 Wotan: The virtual choir\r
for Kontakt is composed of 10 tenors and 10 basses, recorded separately in\r
Sofia Session Studio with three microphone positions (Close, Decca and Hall).\r
Strezov Sampling recorded 8 syllables with 3 layers of dynamics and 2 round\r
robins for staccato samples (sustained samples are also available), screams and\r
whispers with multiple round robins for each syllable and as a bonus you get\r
three types of recorded clusters for tenors and basses with 3 layers of\r
dynamics. To manage the syllables, a Syllabuilder has been integrated, with\r
Connect and Morph modes so that you can create your phrases/sung parts within\r
Kontakt. You can also save and load your creations as presets, a manager is\r
included for these.\r
 Freyja is therefore the\r
female counterpart of Wotan. This new sample bank for the full version of\r
Kontakt 5 compiles the recordings of ten professional alto singers and as many\r
sopranos at Sofia Session Studio.\r
Freyja Female Choir\r
includes an all-new Agile Legato sampling technique that combines legato\r
sampling with an in-house Syllabuilding approach so you can make every syllable\r
in the bank sing with polyphonic legato. In addition, this intelligent system\r
allows you to write polyphonic parts within a single patch. In use, you play a\r
chord with the left hand, a melody with the right hand on your master keyboard\r
and the two parts will be connected with legato transitions, which are managed\r
by most controllers, in particular MIDI CC or a pedal of sustain.\r
Freyja also includes\r
polyphonic true legato patches for altos and sopranos with different velocities.\r
 Arva: Arva completes the\r
Next Generation Choir series launched three years ago. This new bank for the\r
full version of Kontakt 5 samples two separate sections of girls and boys with\r
the possibility of taking advantage of divisi. Àrva has an Agile Legato feature\r
that not only allows you to play each of the 10 available syllables in legato,\r
but also to benefit from polyphonic writing within the same patch thanks to its\r
intelligent Voice Leading function. In use, play a chord with the left hand, a\r
melody with the right hand and the system compatible with most MIDI CC\r
controllers (including the sustain pedal) takes care of creating the legato\r
transitions.\r
Àrva also allows you to\r
mix the three positions of Close, Decca and Hall microphones and to dose the\r
house convolution reverb.\r
Like Wotan and Freya,\r
which you can combine with this new bank to create a full and massive choir,\r
Àrva includes polyphonic true legato patches (Ah, Mm, Ooh, Mm-Ah, Mm-Ooh, Mm-\r
Ooh-Ah) for each divisi, as well as the latest version 3 of the SyllaBuilder to\r
build vocal phrases in a few clicks and control sample attack, release, volume\r
and offset. This new version brings compatibility between all the choir banks\r
of the Next Generation Choir series, so you can share presets and lyrics when\r
building your virtual choir"""

Inspired by the highly\r
sought after Moog Taurus Mk1 Bass Synthesizer, the Bass Pedals combine powerful\r
analog source sounds with modern tone shaping capabilities to create a\r
versatile, fully programmable bass synthesizer!\r
Bass Pedals for Kontakt\r
offers four main editing pages:\r
Preset Page\r
The preset page is capable\r
of loading 28 extensively multi-sampled patches designed and recorded from a\r
vintage Moog Taurus MK1 bass synthesizer. All preset patches offer 3\r
turn-by-turn sound variations and long samples to help capture the\r
imperfections of the original instrument. The sounds on this page can be edited\r
and mixed with Bass Pedals' "raw oscillators" to create interesting\r
"hybrid" patches.\r
Raw Oscillator Page\r
(Synthesizer)\r
Synthesize your own\r
"Taurus-like" sounds using the raw oscillators of the bass pedals...\r
The raw mode has 2 analog oscillators (each with switchable overdriven\r
waveforms thanks to an Empirical Labs Fatso), 1 switchable sub-oscillator,\r
noise source and oscillator unison modes, all of which are individually fed by\r
a comprehensive set of carefully looped waveforms recorded from a Taurus MK1\r
analog bass synthesizer\r
Effects Page\r
The effects page features\r
a number of fully editable effects as well as specially created IR reverbs\r
(impulse responses) recorded from our Eventide DSP-7000 harmonizer.\r
Controls page\r
The controls page lets you\r
control the mono mode of instruments with selectable note priorities,\r
portamento, pitch bend range, keyboard velocity, and curve response. It is\r
important to note that just like the original Moog Taurus; Bass Pedals was\r
designed to be a monophonic instrument. A custom Kontakt script is used to\r
realistically "cut" previous notes once a new key is played, even\r
when using Amp Screenshot settings.\r

description = """
W1 Limiter is a clone of Waves L1, with identical output, as well as an approximation of Waves L2. \r
This was accomplished without reverse engineering Waves products, and the result was obtained by adjusting 4Front YLimiter by doing the following: \r
\r
* Simplifying release curve \r
* Increasing release time 3 times (see notes below) \r
* Altering softening circuit filter \r
\r
Waves L1 famous limiter (and thus W1 - for compatibility reasons) uses three times longer actual release time than the standard RT60 metric. This means that if you set a 50ms release in the limiter, it will actually yield a 150ms standard RT60 release time. \r
Different engineers recommend different values for release time; the default value is chosen reasonably to provide a smooth limiting for most typical usage of the limiter. If one is not experienced with limiters, keeping the default release time is recommended. \r
The current version also adds the adaptive release. I tried to replicate Waves L2; however, their tangent curve is very complex, so I could only approximate its behaviour (which actually should be pretty close, but unlike the L1 part, it won't be digitally identical). Waves ARC uses fixed thresholds of 250 and 500ms, while W1 still allows changing release time while in adaptive mode. Also, IDR dithering is not emulated, but most DAWs these days have dithered export options."""

Another feature included is the ability to alter the release sound when the final note is played and released.

The Master Solo Strings begins with the most detailed, carefully sampled and realistic solo viola virtual instrument (Kontakt 4 or 5 Full Only).
When approaching the Master Solo Strings, our initial thoughts were to begin with the solo violin, as out of the four main bowed string instruments, it is by far the most prominently used soloist instrument. With further consideration, we decided it might be perfect to focus and actually begin with a meticulously sampled solo viola.
There are already many sampled violins, and we have contributed some ourselves, so let's open with the viola!
Considering adding a violin solo to your score? The violin has a beautiful sound - no doubt about it - but consider giving an extra special colour to your music by adding a viola solo, a warmer, lusher and deeper sound, which listeners will be less accustomed to, and pleasantly surprised by.

There have never been computer-created, yet nuanced instruments like these.
CHH Pro Complete is the most complete virtual-instrument library of Brass & Woodwind instruments for Jazz, Pop, Big-Band, Funk production but also for spicing up your cinematic and orchestral tracks. With CHH Complete you get 54 Solo and 32 Section Instruments, divided into four volumes which contain different groups of instruments perfectly matching each other. With its latest Pro update, Chris Hein’s library debuts phase-synchronised samples for perfect blends between velocities.
This procedure optimises interdependent samples and allows silky smooth velocity crossfades from piano to forte. Use the instrument´s full dynamic capabilities to create a vivid performance.
Chris Hein Horns Pro:
• C-Flute Instrument
• The new C-Flute was deeply sampled in great detail and a variety of playing styles such as Non Vibrato, Vibrato, Singing and even Shakuhachi Style. This instrument adds a different colour to the palette.
• All new Graphical User Interface
• The all new user Interface makes tweaking and editing a breeze. Sculpt the sound of the instrument and define exactly how it reacts to your playing.
• Phase synchronised samples for perfect blends between velocities
• All Sustain Samples and some other articulations got phase-synced. This procedure optimises interdependent samples and allows silky smooth velocity crossfades from piano to forte. Use the instrument´s full dynamic capabilities to create a vivid performance.
• Extremely customisable Articulation Presets including copy paste feature
• The articulation presets are now even more customisable, using the latest features of the Kontakt engine, for example the time machine and the transient designer. Individually control speed, panorama, volume, transpose and many more parameters of each instrument’s playing style.
• New Key-Switch preset management
• We re-invented the management of key-switch presets. Each setting of a preset can now easily be copied to any other preset. You can even save all presets of a patch, including your personal key-switch preferences, and import them into another one. Save time and organise key-switches the way you want them.
• New flexibel Hot-Key management
• Articulations can be unloaded to save memory
• Improved Ram Management. All articulations and ram-demanding effects can be loaded or unloaded individually. Remove unused articulations and switch off ram-demanding effect settings to free up memory and keep the memory footprint as low as possible.
• Speed Change for all articulations
• The speed of all articulations can be adjusted individually. This is not only useful for the time-depending articulations like Crescendo, Runs or Falls. Also sustains, shake and trills benefit from the time adjustment, because it changes the attack and the general sound of the sample.
• There are now five different velocity X-Fade Modes providing you with maximum flexibility to control the dynamic of the instrument. Play realistic Crescendi and Swells locked to the song tempo using the two new Auto X-Fade Modes.
• Velocity Fade Filter
• Transient Designer
• Additional Effects: Attack Shapes, Air, Noise, Release Effects
• The new effects are perfect to dial in liveliness. Add up to three layers of different Attack Samples to give your sound more punch or dirt, or blend in sounds of playing-noises and air flowing through the instrument to bring it closer to the listener.
• 16 new Convolution Impulses for Reverb
• Improved Key-Vibrato
• Two independent, intelligent LFO-Vibrato types
• Auto vibrato
• Auto Vibrato uses musical values, based on the song tempo, to blend in natural modulation of tune and volume.
• Assignable Pitch-Bend
• Popular playing styles like falls or shakes are now assignable to the Pitch-Bend Wheel. Trigger these effects intuitively without having to remember key-switches.
• iPad and iPhone real time remote controller
• Based on Hexler’s TouchOSC we programmed a real time controller for all features in CHH-Pro. Instead of fiddling with CC data in your DAW, you just record the automation data from your iPhone or iPad.
Due to highly intelligent programming the solo instruments can easily be combined to small or large sections via section mode. Several out of the box section instruments are also included. The intuitive user interface is mainly focussed on best playability. Various legato and glide-mode features allow very realistic note transitions, while outstanding new functions like key-vibrato, hotkeys and the revolutionary new key-switch concept are essential for live performance.
All instruments obey the same concept, so once you know one, you know them all. Each volume contains solo instruments as well as section combinations. Every instrument was played by famous big-band musicians in separate sessions but to one another, which results in perfect harmony of the sections and allows maximum flexibility for the producer.
General Features
• Chris Hein Horns is an outstanding brass instruments sample library.
• aprox. 2.000 Samples per instrument
• 18 different playing techniques
• All playing techniques in one programm
• Up to 8 Velocities per note

description = "The Orchestra is a revolutionary all-in-one 80 player orchestral library whose heart is our breakthrough Ensemble Engine that empowers you to turn your ideas into music. Simple and incredibly fast. The Ensemble Engine works through a number of independent arpeggiators and velocity envelopes, heavily inspired by our Sonuscore Origins-Series. Create pulsating rhythms and even inspiring full arrangements from any combination of notes. All of this without relying on prerecorded phrases — you have the full control. With minimum loading times, a vast amount of presets provides you with full ensemble colors right out of the box. Choose from 192 presets in three categories: Orchestral Colors, Orchestral Rhythms, Animated Orchestra. Play your ideas and your melodies freely with the single instrument patches. Aside from the Ensemble Instrument, The Orchestra also contains 89 single instrument patches for all standard sections, including percussion, a Glockenspiel and as a bonus: choir. Unleash the full orchestral power with over 75 multi-rack patches: Full Orchestral Multis for single articulations, ideal for quick sketching and layering. Animated Multis combine multiple instances of The Orchestra for even more complex patterns. The samples: rough & edgy — no Hollywood-polished sound. Recorded in Budapest at the renowned Studio 22 in their traditional seating position and mixed and edited with great attention to detail. All essential articulations are available, including playable true legato samples and multiple round robins for short articulations."

SVBLIME EST (Old Latin pron. Sobleema Aest) — Translation: It’s Sublime
This is not a real orchestra, but the first library in the world designed to sound like one, created over two years using DOVInst synthesis, morphing, and audio post-processing. Every sound was manually edited for lushness and phase optimization, embracing natural imperfections of digital synthesis.
Inspired by composers such as Horner, Elfman, Morricone, Johansson, Badalamenti, Desplat, Vangelis, Williams, Zimmer, and more.
Percussion is fully original, though the snare lacks the full dynamics of a real drum.
A simple UI keeps focus on sound — a first step toward true digital organicity in orchestral emulation.

CineSamples and the team at London’s Abbey Road Studios recorded and sampled two vintage upright pianos for Kontakt 5.
The Abbey Road Classic Upright Pianos collection features the sound of two historic acoustic uprights:
A Challen Studio Piano, built in London by Piano Works in the 1930s and famously used on Beatles albums, with a tone described as soft and warm.
Two patches were produced:
• the first with its natural tone,
• the second called Challen Tack, with the Tack mechanism engaged, which drops brass strips between hammers and strings for a percussive tone.
Mrs Mills, a 1905 Steinway Vertegrand, was modified by the Abbey Road team in the late 1950s by lacquering the hammer felts to harden them, creating a brighter and more percussive tone (famously heard on Penny Lane and With a Little Help from My Friends). This piano was deliberately tuned slightly out of tune at the request of Stuart Eltham.
Both pianos were recorded in Abbey Road’s Studio 2.
Kontakt Interface:
• Three mix options, all usable simultaneously:
- Modern: three pairs of condenser microphones
- Room: Decca Tree configuration + a pair of ambient mics
- Vintage: AKG D19C (dynamic cardioid), Neumann U67 and AKG C12 (cardioid condensers) + original REDD.37 console

Slower is an instrument library featuring high-end sample content, recorded to four distinct tape machines. The recordings are then played back at half-speed so all sounds are pitched down by one octave. Familiar instruments become magical, warm, and tangible. Explore a diverse range of sounds, including keys, guitars, strings, woodwinds, brass, and much more.
• Why Half Speed Tape
Half-speed tape transforms familiar sounds like pianos and strings into something uniquely textured and captivating. By pitching down analog tape, you achieve a depth and warmth that digital methods can’t replicate. Natural tape characteristics such as wobble, noise, and flutter add rich, organic layers.
• Four Tape Machine Types
Studio: Studer A812 and Revox PR99 - large open reel to reel
Portable: Uher 4400 Report IC and Uher 4400 Report Monitor - small reel to reel
Cassette: Tascam Portastudio 424mkiii - standard cassette
Dictaphone: Sony M650v dictaphone - micro cassette
• Diverse Instruments
With 65 different sound sources, each recorded on four distinct tape machines, and a wealth of synthesized sounds, Slower offers a deep collection of unique tones, including rarities like dulcimer, glockenspiel, and harmonium. The tape process transforms grand and upright pianos, electric and acoustic guitars, and orchestral strings, while synthesizer recordings add rich, evolving pads and intricate textures.
• Powerful Sound Design Engine
27 built-in effects, amp envelope, LFOs, modulation envelope, step modulator, aftertouch, and a customizable five-slot FX chain for delay, distortion, reverb, filters, and more. Reverse samples enable ethereal slow-attack sounds, with separate noise and wobble controls. Most parameters can be modulated.
• Macro Controls and Preset Library
Three single-knob macros enable real-time transformations. 230 presets crafted by top sound designers provide instant inspiration, from warm, moody pianos to deep, textured winds with authentic, rich qualities. """

Melody: one of the purest, simplest forms of music and, at the same time, one of the most demanding challenges for composers of any time
Since ancient times, melody has been one of the most immediate forms of expression, as its boundaries blur into language, sound, and, after all, magic. Little by little, the development of technologies, from the log drum to the pipe organ, has led humankind to better understand the potentialities of melody as a form of communication, an introspective and emotive probe, and art.
As the primary shaman skill, mastering melodies has evolved from the work of refined composers in the king’s service to a powerful medium to support ideals.
By talking to each other through dialogue and overlaying melodies, we have created an unsurpassed and unique form of expression: melodies, or rather the Music. Lately, loop-based devices, from the mellotron to the most renowned sampler, have brought melodies to a new level of complexity.
MELODIES is a unique library that encourages experimentation and gives any musician a new array of tools for his/her compositions.

Featuring solo violin, viola, and cello, the library uses our Smart Legato engine for ultra-realistic playback and expressive control, with two legato types (standard and portamento) and a variety of long, short, and swelled articulations.
We collaborated with first-chair players from the chamber ensemble behind String Formations, bringing unique character and expression to this library.

Enter the world of violinist and composer Alexander Parsons, with his collection of evocative soundscapes and string textures.
Alongside a collection of unique string textures performed by Alexander, the library includes synth samples and a rare Faulkner Dulcichord tabletop piano from his collection of instruments, all of which can be manipulated in our custom granular patch designed specifically for this library.
Partnering with composer Alexander Parsons, a trained violinist with a background in electronic music, Trails captures his textural approach to composition. The library features solo strings, a violin performed by Alexander himself, alongside other instruments from his collection.
Long and short string textures are ideal for layering, building tension, and adding movement, while our signature Atmosphere Layers seamlessly blend acoustic and electronic elements.
Trails includes the Layer Blends patch with 28 curated synth sounds and a newly developed Granular Engine, offering endless possibilities to reshape and combine sounds.
Designed as a composer’s toolkit, every articulation was created for use in professional scoring, with intuitive controls for even the most complex features.
Trails is the perfect library for evocative documentary, small-scale drama, or any project that demands a rich, versatile palette of textures and atmospheres.
This library features sixteen solo violin and cello textures performed by Alexander Parsons and cellist Joe Zeitlin, recorded in a dry studio to maximise sound-shaping possibilities.
Using the Granular Engine alongside Lo-Fi, Delay, Reverb, and 16 Atmosphere Layers, the original string recordings are transformed into evolving textures with limitless creative potential, what Alexander calls Trails.
The Granular Engine, inspired by Alexander Parsons’ personal workflow and Fracture Sounds’ expertise, transforms the library’s sounds into evolving textures. Reverse, mutate, and tweak recordings, or be instantly inspired with one of the 57 curated presets.
All synths are integrated into the Layer Blends engine, allowing up to three samples to be blended and controlled via the mod wheel. With 28 unique synth sounds, the library offers 546 possible combinations, further refined using the available controls.
A highlight of Alexander’s expansive collection is the rare Faulkner Dulcichord, a single-stringed tabletop piano prized for its delicate, characterful tone. For added flexibility, it features Colour and Timbre Shift controls, along with an extended range switch."""

Ultimate Heavy Drums is an extremely versatile drum kit. Boasting 14 different snares, 10 different kick drums, 3 sets of toms and a wide array of cymbals. These impressive sounds are finely honed and pre-processed to perfection. The instrument also harbours an incredibly valuable arsenal of built-in mixing features.
Designed and recorded by Josh Middleton, an award winning guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and producer from the UK. Josh has been involved in producing and mixing a wide variety of bands throughout his career (Sylosis, Architects, Kreator, Heriot, Nakkeknaeker, Malevolence).
Tilt EQ
The tilt EQ will allow you make any piece of the kit brighter or darker with a simple horizontal fader. I wanted this library to be fully processed and (mix-ready) as soon as you open it. But having the ability to fine-tune how bright or dark each element is will give you even more control over these sounds in your mix.
Transient Designer
This enables you to increase or decrease the attack and sustain of each individual piece of the kit to give you maximum control of the punch and sustain of every element of your drum mix.
Envelope Filters
The envelope filters also enable you to control the attack, sustain and release of each kit piece but in a different way to the transient designer. These work more like fade ins and fade outs. The combination of the sustain and release features in particular can allow you to hear a full sustain and resonance in a drum but add a more abrupt fade out."""

description = """
Orb Trumpets is a proof-of-concept release that is created entirely out of performances. Recorded in Orb Studios in Austin, TX - the goal was to create a trumpet patch that took their Adventure-style programming techniques to a more natural-sounding level using samples derived from phrases. It’s trickier to program and hone, but the resulting fluidity is compelling. Like the larger orchestral releases, the Adventure-style programming requires no keyswitching. For quicker notes, you’re going to want to play within the 1-100 velocity range. For longer notes, 101-127 provides a slightly broader attack. Switching between the two provides an effective approximation of how brass players tend to shape certain notes within a variety of phrases. Tuning was lightly done to taste instead of destructively tuning it with software. Musical Sampling retained the natural biases in intonation up the range/dynamics while pulling in the more squirrely notes, resulting in a more natural temperament.

• Adventure (FFF Sus Layer)

We recorded a guitar fitted with lipstick single-coil pickups for their articulate, glassy tone. Their naturally scooped mids help reduce muddiness while preserving crisp highs and pure bass. The bridge and neck pickups were recorded separately so you can blend between the classic twang of the bridge and the warm, woody sound of the neck.
The library contains both the raw recorded signal and an enhanced signal which you may blend to taste.
Built on the Evolution engine, this product gives you:
• a flexible mapping system
• a pattern editor and chord/voicing system optimized for strums and picking
• a built-in effects suite suited for mix-ready baritone guitar tones
• pick position control via physical modeling
• techniques including sustains, palm mutes, mutes, natural harmonics, string slaps, muted strums, divebombs
• legato articulations (slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs)
• 3 dynamics, 4× round-robin
• string resonance and vibrato (adjustable speed and depth)
• a dynamic memory option to unload unused articulations from memory"""

The lowest two octaves were sampled using softer bass marimba mallets as an alternate to standard mallets; these bass mallets are ideal for ambient or cinematic contexts.
The library includes realistic playable rolls. These scripts simulate how a marimbist divides notes among mallets during a roll, and allow control over velocity and roll speed in real time via MIDI CC.
A unique staccato articulation is provided: hitting the bar and holding the mallet against it to mute the sound rapidly, creating a staccato effect.

Organic Samples is renowned for its colorful instruments. A source of inspiration made up of fluid solo legato voices, ethnically influenced samples, and light, clever instruments.
We are delighted to announce that Organic Samples is now available exclusively at Orchestral Tools. Organic Samples is a series of creative instruments, which will be continued with many additions to come.

This sound was emblematic of the era, giving the rhythms a drier, more percussive quality. Bass drums often had heads with internal padding to dampen their resonance, while toms and snare drums were muffled with dampeners or foams. This style of production helped create a distinct vibe, often associated with genres like classic rock, funk and disco. Over the next few years, the drum damped sound returned to the forefront, popularized by influential British bands.

Inspired by film and classical music icons, the collection offers Auto Divisi combined with Polyphonic True Legato from the next generation choir engine, Round Robin Legato for fast ostinatos, and a thematic approach to playing techniques.
Instead of static generic samples, Afflatus Chapter I offers several custom-made articulation groups able to portray one specific style per group with ease.
The styles/moods range from classical to modern contemporary film scores. Some masters that inspired the development include Henry Mancini, Sergei Prokofiev, Bernard Herrmann, John Williams, and Arvo Pärt.
The sounds and styles present a vast palette of colors and playing techniques: from modern minimalism to golden-age lush epic ensembles. All inside just one collection.
Strezov gives total control over the sections during performance: pressing the sustain pedal allows polyphonic lines to play divisi for ultra-realistic concert sound or with the whole section for a thick, lush tone suited for modern film, TV, and videogame scores.
Combined with the intelligent voice leading derived from the Polyphonic True Legato engine used in Freyja, Wotan, Árva, and Rhodope, it becomes easier than ever to make string arrangements sound as intended within your DAW."""
