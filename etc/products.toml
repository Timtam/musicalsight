The 1990 Studio Grand Piano is amongst one of our favorite virtual instruments ever done. This extraordinary library contains over 48.000 samples and unique microphones/positions, including Neumann 87’s, Coles, Neve SE Ribbon’s, AKG 414’s and Neumann KM 184’s. Everything was lovingly recorded & processed at a famous hi-tech British Studio through one of the greatest custom NEVE desks in existence. 

We wanted to create a hyper-realistic virtual instrument that pays an homage to its counter-part in reality – the incredibly versatile and studio defacto, Yamaha C7. The piano is best described as incredibly versatile and fantastic for pop, rock, classical, fusion and all in-between. The sustain samples were carefully crafted at both pedal up and pedal down positions. We also have bonus sampled staccato and staccatissimo notes (w/round robin each), so you have the correct attack for faster runs. In addition, the library gives you full control over the dynamic response as well as mechanics and tone, so you can dial in the perfect sound & dynamic match for your workflow – all simply done with a click of the mouse. We also included full control over resonance, room tone and signal chain noise, non-tonal key control, unique release triggers for hammer action, string damping, and release triggers for our room and ambient microphones. In essence you have everything right at your fingertips and most importantly – it just works effortlessly.\

Starting with the Violins, this newly reworked volume brings you the latest improvements in programming and workflow previously found only in our critically acclaimed Century Series. The update includes the familiar and easy to use Century interface, remastered articulations, a powerful articulation matrix, integrated mixing capabilities, and for advanced real-time processing, our Chaos Effects.

With the new advanced Articulation browser, you can create your very own matrix of custom playing styles to suit your compositional needs. You can easily balance each articulation and assign each style its own dedicated Key-switch or Midi CC. Whether you are building a template and need to separate the long and short articulations; building performance-based patches out of the dozens of playing styles; or creating a custom set of patches needed for your specific arrangement, Adagio gives you the power to shape this iconic sound to your workflow.

Say goodbye to Multis. With the update to Adagio, you will find various remastered layered Legato articulations made from 11 independent styles of lyrical Legato.

These Legatos have been completely reworked and redesigned to make expressive string writing completely effortless. The new legatos now adapt to the way you play, a softer velocity will trigger a more passionate set of Legato transitions, whereas playing more intensely triggers Legatos with a stronger transition.

The Adagio series was recorded in a beautiful church environment and contains three main groups of master violinists: Full Ensemble Violins (11 Players), Small Ensemble or Chamber Violins (3 Players) and a Solo Virtuoso Violinist (1 Player). Each section was sampled to capture the raw emotions and true expression within each string ensemble. Every articulation has been extensively sampled, including a total of 11 individual legato techniques, each with up to three times round robin, and a wealth of dynamic short notes including multiple styles of Spiccato. Each articulation is sampled with movement and character; the natural expression in each sample makes for a truly authentic playing experience that will be instantly noticeable in your next production.\

8Dio Aura Guitars is the ultimate collection of deep-sampled motion picture guitars.  Aura Guitars contains 12 different guitars, including Martin, 12 String, Dobro, Mandolin, Ukulele, 8 String Schecter, Silent Guitar, Stratocaster, Telecaster, Les Paul and assortment of Bass Guitars. It contains both multi-sampled single notes and multi-sampled chords. All the chords were sampled in perfect fifth, so you can essentially generate any chord and rhythm you want. All 12 guitars were sampled symmetrically – meaning that you can freely blend anything you want and it will work together. So you literally have billions of patch combinations.

Aura Guitars contains 3 modules, so you can freely mix and blend up to three different guitars together. The collection spans over 9GB of content (lossless compressed from 17GB) and several thousand auras. Aura Guitars also contains an advanced grid-sequencer, which allows you to completely create your own signature rhythms by using velocity, pan, pitch and on/off functions for each step in the Aura. All the guitars were also multi-sampled, so when you play chords you can freely mix between muted/non-tonal strums and glide into rich, open chords by using the modwheel. In addition we also multi-sampled the single notes, so you can create more realistic sounding guitar rhythms.

Aura Guitars is designed for instant gratification. It is insanely easy to use and get inspired – and it also allows you to go incredibly deep and even into the realm of chaos. We created chaos features both both patches, grid-sequencing and FX. So with one click the library can generate a completely new patch – with one click it can generate a completely new grid-sequence and with one click it can randomize all the FX. In essence you have an infinite amount of combinations and it just makes the library a true inspiration to work with.\

So imagine playing a unique Caisa with brushes or sticks. The ability to choose mallets widens the usability of the library, especially in regards to cinematic scoring.

Aura Tonal Exotic Studio Percussion contains 3 microphone positions (Close, Mid, Room) that each have a very distinct sound. We’ve also included a new dual layered FX system. The first part is our front-face FX system that gives you control over dynamics, filters, pitch and micro-pitch, delay, bit-resolution and our new textural convolution delay. The new textural delay allows you to take and use them as delay components, so the instrument will delay other sounds than just itself. We’ve also included our new Chaos FX engine, which gives you a large control over things such as EQ, Distortion, Stereo-Delay and an additional convolution reverb.

It has always been our mantra to push sampling forward in regards to realism and playability. Aura Studio Exotic Percussion is the first of several to utilize our proprietary Groove Sampling™ method and we really think it is going to make compositions richer and easier to create.\

The library features five highly expressive solo woodwind players, a Flute, Oboe, Cor Anglais, Clarinet, and Bass Clarinet. Each player was recorded in isolation, but all at the same time, so you can fluidly switch between any instrument and any articulation without compromising the sound or timing of your music. 

The sound of the ensemble is easily customizable with the wealth of options in the advanced user-interface. Each instrument also allows for extreme control over the stereo image with individual volume, panning, output routing, and the new distance control, which enables you to freely blend between a direct signal and a more spacious and ambient microphone position. 

Intimate Studio Woodwinds contains a vast collection of 26 articulations covering everything you need to create authentic-sounding woodwind melodies. Each articulation is sorted into four main categories (Traditional, Arcs, Performance, and Effects), making them all quickly and easily accessible from the built-in browser. The advanced user interface allows you to load and unload the articulations of your choosing, so you only have to load the sounds you need for your project. The Legatos are incredibly agile and can play almost anything you throw at them.\

Ostinato Strings Chapter II features a dynamically arranged ensemble of 6 Violins, 6 Violas, 4 Cellos, and 4 Double Basses. Each section was independently recorded to allow for ultimate flexibility and customization in the production process. This collection of instruments perfectly captures the essence and realism of many iconic ostinato based string patterns used in modern cinema, making this latest chapter the perfect companion to any orchestral palette. 

Each figure is not only available across an instrument’s musical range, but is also fully host tempo synchronized. Utilizing our “poly-time” legato mode also offers you the ability to change a phrase’s pitch mid-way through the pattern, allowing for an almost endless array of rhythmic and tonal possibilities. 

The entire Ostinato Strings series was painstakingly captured at 96 kHz before being carefully down-sampled to 48 kHz for ease of streaming. Each recording session also featured only the very best in recording equipment, ensuring an analog signal path and carefully managed workflow. This not only preserves and enhances the accuracy and character of each instrument, but helps us to truly honor the sound of these master musicians. 

Century is and always will be more than a collection of sample libraries to us. Each one tells the story of our musical journey: emotional, distinct, and undoubtedly one of the most realistic series of instruments ever launched.

In fact, we used two independent Leslies (and blew up a third): one to capture the genre defining rotations at all speeds, and another with a modified motor to record the pure unhindered tone of the Leslie itself. 

Both Leslies are available within the 8Dio Vintage Organ. “Analog” highlights the natural acoustics of the Hammond® Leslie and its expressive spinning states.  “Modelled” demonstrates the static, non-spinning, pure timbre of the Leslie cabinet, with a virtual rotation applied. This allows you to choose the tone and workflow that best suits you.

In contemporary Punjabi music, dhols with synthetic, or plastic treble skins are very common.

We recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples.

True Legato

Multiple sets of true legato intervals were recorded both with and without vibrato, for the ultimate in realistic sounding performance.

Trills/Tremolos

Select this articulation, and you can play a trill or tremolo between any two notes by holding them down on the keyboard (up to seven notes apart/a perfect fifth). See the video demo below for a demonstration of this.

Key Noises

These woodwind instruments owe part of the character of their sound to the mechanics of the instrument, so we decided to come up with something that allows some form of control over this subtle characteristic in timbre. What we ended up with was a knob that can control the level of mechanical noise that is audible from the instrument. You can turn this up, or off completely in the GUI to set the average level that seems right, and it will then, on top of this, react to the velocity of your own playing, much like it would a real player pressing harder or softer.

Please note, as vibrato on the Clarinet is not a standard technique, we have not included it, but the other four instruments all include vibrato legato as WELL as non vibrato legato and sustains, all at multiple crossfade-able dynamic layers (MIDI CC1/Mod Wheel).
You are even able to control the level/volume of the key sounds/mechanics of the instruments, and the sound of the flautist pressing the keys will also be louder depending on how hard you press the key on your MIDI keyboard (velocity).

One feature we are exceptionally proud of is the intuitive trills articulation system, which allows you to play any trill/tremolo within the flute's playable range up to a perfect fifth (seven chromatic notes)... See the demo video for an insight in to how this works!

With an instrument as diverse, capable, and exposed as the violin, there is no cutting corners, so we strived to capture as much of the possible sounds a violin can make as possible, resulting in the huge list of articulations you can see below, as well as four sampled legato styles, also shown below. We even specially sampled slurred and bowed legato so you can correctly and realistically phrase passages, and a specially sampled "fast legato" set of intervals, which will allow you to play virtuosic runs and scale passages.

On top of this, we want our instruments to be as close in sonic-flexibility to a real situation as they can be, so in addition to providing close and stage mic positions, we have also made sure to have both a ribbon and condenser mic, which you can choose to switch between. Both sounds offer so much in their own right, the ribbon having a beautiful smooth tone, and the condenser being ruthless in exposing every little detail in the sound.

The stereo mic position can be widened and narrowed by dragging the mics in the interface.

We wanted to make this instrument even more musical, so we have once again used our idea of the "phrase builder", which allows you to select the attack, or beginning sound of a phrase, and then switch around the type of legato throughout a musical phrase.

One huge give-away that an instrument is a sampled one and not a real instrument is how the beginning of every musical phrase sounds the same. A great performer will not sound like this. They will vary the phrase beginnings, and perhaps start some quietly, some with an FP, some with a stutter, and so we have included five options for this, to ensure that your compositions sound evolving, musical, and extremely convincing.

The width of the stereo mic perspective can be changed by dragging the bottom pair of microphones in the interface, and dynamics can be brought up and down by either the mod wheel or expression Midi CC - depending on whether you have MOD or EXP selected in the bottom right hand corner of the instrument GUI, and the shorts' dynamics are controlled by velocity.

Four True-sampled Legato Styles

We spent a while tackling how to approach allowing the user to play both slow more drawn out passages, and then also being able to create realistic renditions of more virtuosic, fast passages, and eventually came up with a very intricate technique which allows both.

We sampled these intervals completely differently, and set it up so you can switch between these depending on whether you are playing fast or not. So for the faster legato, you can switch to "fast" with the legato keyswitching, and play intervals up to and including a minor third in your scales and runs, maintaining a very realistic sound. The sound of the note transitions on a violin when playing fast is completely different from the sound when playing slower, and both are captured and skilfully programmed into this instrument.

Types of Legato

* Slurred Legato - switching note with the finger only, without changing bow direction... the smoothest legato sound.
* Bowed Legato - changing the bow at the note change. A more noticeable interval. (slurred and bowed legato are both essential in obtaining a realistic and well phrased performance)
* Portamento Legato - a subtle slide between notes.
* Fast Legato - Specially sampled intervals which allow you to play fast runs/scales with intervals up to a minor third between each note - something seriously lacking and rarely possible with most sample libraries.

ARTICULATION LIST

* Normal Sustain
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)
* Crescendo
* FP (loud then suddenly quiet with a crescendo back up)

We are proud to present Octohorn, the first release from our brass series, with an eight-player French Horn ensemble, boasting no less then seven mic positions, with the aims of giving you absolute and ultimate control over your soundscape.

This instrument was created with the intentions of producing something in a completely new league of sonic sculpt-ability, able to sit in a track with the depth and spread of a real ensemble recording. We have achieved this through multiple new and innovative features, including the seven mic positions, carefully set to cover the whole soundscape, recorded chords and octaves to minimize "sample layering" in tracks, which kills the depth of a track, and much more...

Mix between the perspectives; Decca tree sides and mid, flanks, room, woodwind spots (see more about this below!), close ribbons and close LDCs, with the flexibility aimed at replicating a real scoring session. Now you have control over the different mic and perspective levels in the session, enabling you to morph your own sound in your scores, as if you were at the studio with the console at your fingertips.

You might have noticed that one of the perspectives included is "woodwind spots". While this is not a woodwind library, the mics that spot the woodwinds were set up and included in the recording. The reason for this, is that a lot of the brass sound bleeds heavily into the woodwind mics in scoring sessions, adding to the perceived depth of the sound, so whilst pushing to achieve the most versatile, we felt that this absolutely had to be included.

Three True-sampled Legato Styles

The instrument comes with three true legato modes - a normal slurred legato, a sample octave legato, and a fast legato, for faster passages,which will allow you to play virtuoso runs and scale passages.

The reason we included octave sustains and legato, is because when you play octaves by layering the same instrument twice, what you are hearing is no longer a real octave passage, but two sets of the exact same horns, in the exact same position, layered on top of one another. When an ensemble plays real octave, every note has it's own sonic space and position in hall, and therefore in the perceived depth/stereo field, and you lose this by layering samples. For this reason, we recorded octave sustains and legato specially for a completely true and real sound. 

Not only did we just record the octaves, we recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... again for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples. With this instrument, you can achieve that real spacious sound.

Full list of articulations:

* No Legato (allows polyphonic playing)
* Legato - normal slurred legato (piano and forte dynamic layers crossfade-able)
* Oct Legato - True octave legato
* Fst Legato - Fast legato specially for fast playing
* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)
* Chords < - Crescendo major, minor and open 5th chords
* Chords > - Diminuendo major, minor and open 5th chords
* Staccato - Short notes, with up to 5RR per dynamic layer (three layers)

Music composition and production is constantly evolving, and the tools used to create music need to evolve along with this. The concept for this library involved capturing colours from a string orchestra which have not yet been recorded for any sample library, and place them at your fingertips, ready to compose and perform with.

Angel Strings Vol.1 Includes textural elements, morphing into/out from atonality, risers/divebombs ideal for building tension (for example in trailer music), different styles of spiccato/staccato, marcato to soft attacks with sustains, fast tempo-locked tremolo for powerful driving string hooks and more...

The techniques and articulations available in Angel Strings Vol.1 were cleverly recorded with the entire string orchestra in the same room all at once, in a way that seamlessly blends from the bottom of the range (double basses) to the highest violin notes. You can play the entire orchestra with each articulation across a single keyboard with a single NKI, making this library perfect for anything from merely sketching your ideas out on a full keyboard range - to easily executing unique parts for your final compositions.

THE STUDIOANGEL STUDIOS
This library was recorded at Angel Studios in London, where countless pop/rock stars have recorded (notably Adele's "21"), and many major film and video game scores have been recorded, including The Lion King, Jackie, Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Horizon: Zero Dawn and many more...

Angel Strings Vol.1 is another collaboration between Auddict and the fantastic "United Strings of Europe", a London-based ensemble made up of young professionals from across the European Union and Switzerland with the goal of promoting musical and cultural cooperation at the highest level.

The ensemble is gaining recognition for its exciting performances in Switzerland, France, Lebanon and the UK. With several world premieres of works by Hristic, Marinkovic and Winkler, the ensemble has collaborated with a number of distinguished artists including Hildegarde Fesneau, Marc Benzekri, Mateja Marinkovic, Jack Liebeck, Walter Delahunt and Ljubisa Jovanovic.

You can transform the hard-hitting drummer trio we used during the sessions (which gave the library its name) into an army of players, ready to crush anything standing in their way.

The three headed monster.

Cerberus is all about tight and punchy drums, covering from Gran Cassas, Kicks, Toms and Snares to Clacks and Clicks. We recorded a trio of players, each one playing two drums at the same time, giving you a total of 6 simultaneous sounding drums. This results in a larger-than-life sound without losing any tightness.

You need more players?, here’s an army for you.

Because bigger is better than big, Cerberus offers a state-of-the-art functionality for stacking drums. We recorded the triple amount of round robins, so you could stack up to 3 different layers. That gives you 18 simultaneous sounding drums! You can even add timing/pan variation to each hit to make it sound looser/broader.

Droom Loops.

Cerberus comes loaded with a large set of tempo synced drum loops, all created from the original source material. The loops come in 120bpm, 90bpm, 4/4, and 3/4 variations. Each loop additionally has the low, mid, and high stems laid out on the keyboard, allowing you to layer stems to create your own combinations. For a TV or library composer who writes lots of underscore, these loops are going to be incredible time savers.

Still not enough? Here’s an extra full drum kit.

We included a beautiful sounding drum kit just in case you’re feeling those metal/rock vibes, the icing of the cake.

The goal throughout the whole project was to start with the user experience and the raw sound and to work our way backwards to a final product that is both versatile and instantly inspiring.
The Gravitas Piano was designed specifically for trailer music. A piano that can cut through in a big and epic mix, yet still retain a lot of warmth and depth. To achieve this, we used a set of six stereo microphones and then combined these with their corresponding sound-designed (“Synthetic”) counterparts in post production.

Organic Piano: Yamaha Baby Grand Piano

* 2x Brauner Phantom Classic Front End Audio Microphones (above the piano)
* 2x DPA 4011A Cardioid Microphones (below the piano)
* 2x Neumann KM184 Small-diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphones (above the keys, one on each side of the player)
* 2x Neumann U87 Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphones (inside the lid)
* 2x Coles 4038 Ribbon Microphones (inside the lid)
* 2x Earthworks QTC40 Small-diaphragm Omnidirectional Condenser Microphones (room)

The Gravitas Piano comes with 35 “Synthetic” presets, made by some of the best producers in the trailer industry. These “Synthetic” presets can be accessed via the preset control on the “Synthetic” side of the piano. The “Organic” piano offers both Sustained and Staccato articulations. All of the “Synthetic” presets were made using the original samples from the “Organic” piano. No synthesizers or other instruments were used, just pure sound manipulation and sound design.

* Bryan Leach

Red Planet Piano (Piano meets Electric Guitar).

The “Red Planet Piano” was heavily inspired by the movie adaptation of Andy Weir’s “The Martian”. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is absolutely amazing and inspired us to create an “outer space” version of the Klavier. 
The Red Planet Piano shares the same organic sample pool used for the Gravitas Piano. But to get that particular “outer space” electric guitar sound, we created a number of complex guitar sounds. They are designed to match that lush and wide sound that you need to evoke that feeling of depth and space. This, combined with the organic piano, creates a truly unique sound.
We used a blend of the neck (humbucker) and the split-coil (single coil) position of the very limited Ibanez JPM90HAM. A perfect blend of the single coil twang and directness and the warmth and depth of the neck humbucker. The initial recordings were done direct and we then reamped the recordings through various amp and fx signal chains.\

Two types of long-form true legato | No key-switching required.

Introducing Legato Combined

We recorded two types of legato for each instrument: Rebowed and Slurred for Strings, Fingered and Retongued for Woodwinds and Brass, Aah and Ooh for the Sopranos. You can even switch between the two types of legato without using key-switches, by using either velocity or CC. 

Less is more.

We recorded just one dynamic layer on legato articulations, which is actually better for solo instruments. The less crossfades you do, the less phasing artifacts you get.
This unique dynamic layer contains all the musicality and emotion you will ever need. The recipe: slight crescendo-diminuendos, some progressive vibrato, and voilà. It just works.

With Trailer Guitars 2 you get that instant satisfaction of getting the sound you're craving for with zero effort and zero knowledge. It can go from clean and angelic to distorted and hellish in a second.

Multisampled, multitracked.

The big player of Trailer Guitars 2 is the Multisamples. We recorded 13 different articulations in mono, twice. This allows you to pan each one of the recording sets to L and R independently. The result: A breathtaking stereo sound out of the box. You can even control both of the channels volume and pan independently.

The simplest of loops.

We recorded a huge set of "simple loops". These are basic and generic sequences that are very commonly played on backing electric guitars, which are specially useful for adding some organic movement to your tracks.

It’s your space laboratory, your mix fixer, and your utility tool. It’s simple, flexible – and most importantly, it sounds out of this world.

* THREE DIMENSIONS: RAUM’s three modes cover everything from realistic rooms to experimental reflections and sonic space-travel sound design. Whether you’re adding depth to your pads, or want to extract high-fidelity textures from a one-shot sample, it has you covered.
* GROUNDED: This room-style reverb covers everything from tiny ambiences to large chambers, and delivers bucketloads of in-your-face reflections with a dense reverb tail. It’s perfect for adding weight and polish to percussive sounds, but can really take sounds to their limits with a little experimentation.
* AIRY: A hall-style reverb with natural early reflections that will elevate vocals, smooth-out synths, and swell pianos. The modulation control adds extra movement to the reverb, turning sounds from lush to freaky at the twist of a knob.
* COSMIC: Your zero-gravity sonic laboratory. Get busy with the pre-delay section to craft everything from complex resonances to granular textures, and metallic sounds, and take things further with the modulation knob for even wilder soundscapes. Cosmic is reverb reinvented.
* RAUM TO EXPERIMENT: RAUM’s pre-delay and modulation sections are where it makes the leap from the utilitarian to sound-sculpting experimentalism.
* PRE-DELAY: RAUM’s pre-delay section is packed with potential, with an enormous spectrum of potential uses. Increase the feedback using a short delay for metallic, comb-filter sounds, and sync it for echo or looping style effects
* MODULATION: Add a shifting, detuned feel to RAUM’s reverb tails, or go all-out in the Cosmic mode for wonky atmospheric soundscapes and unique granular textures.\

Musicians

Nashville is home to some of the finest musicians in the world.  Top players from all over the country have come to be a part of Nashville’s music scene, including the orchestras. Nashville Scoring Strings features half section sized of 8 violins, 6 violas, 5 celli, 4 basses.

Studio

Ocean Way Studio A has become lauded for its unique sound.  Established in an old church, the room has a well defined early reflection and highly controlled ambiance.  Its flexible, yet large 3-D sound makes it an ideal venue for string sampling.

Performance

We approached sampling Nashville Strings through actual performance-based phrases.  All of the short articulations were sourced from real repetitions, and the legatos were captured from actual melodies.  The result is a stellar level of fluidity and musical expressiveness.

All of the major articulations are included in Nashville Scoring Strings and were painstakingly recorded. Featuring legato, spiccato, pizzicato, marcato, trills, tremolo, col legno, all with an extreme level of detail and precision. 
Every articulation was sampled from a musical performance. The spiccato, pizzicato, and col legnos were sourced from true repetitions and have an unmatched fluidity. 

“The performative quality of this library shines through the polished surface, at times making it feel as though you are actually in the studio working with the musicians.”

Performance

Uke features a wide range of riffs, tremolos and playable repetition patches - samples that have been edited out of real performances, and programmed to play back with hyper-realistic connectivity. We captured both tonal and atonal playing styles. 

Tone

We captured an extensive set of playing styles from plucks, picks, and taps to brushes, harmonics and sticks. Most unique styles were sampled both tonally and atonally, all with an emphasis on rhythmic performance. The resulting sounds are unique and well suited to film score.

Interface

The UI features dual band AHDSR controls for sound shaping, advanced controls for flexibility in performance and a powerful 32 step sequencer designed to craft energetic rhythms and grooves. Riffs patches have unique speed controls to either double or half the tempo of a given performance.

A smooth-sounding, pitch-aware reverb that reduces muddiness by removing clashing harmonics as you move from one note or chord to another. Here is the introductory text from the web site.

ADAPTIVERB  is a revolutionary reflectionless reverberation plugin. Unlike traditional reflection-based acoustic room modeling, ADAPTIVERB adds perceived depth, harmonic richness, and butter-smooth tails without obscuring the source. Preserving the tonal definition and directness of your mix, it adds size, glue and body – making it perfect for mixing and mastering applications alike.
Powered by ray tracing, source separation, and advances in artificial intelligence, ADAPTIVERB automatically adapts to the input audio like a chameleon, blending with your sounds perfectly, and conforming its reverb tail to the tonality of the input or a user defined set of notes.
While exceptionally fast to use, its advanced synthesis, cross-filtering and reverb pitch processing functionality provides ambient artists, film composers and sound designers with exciting new creative options for making evolving drones, organic pads, lush ambient sound scapes, and more.

Supports VST 2.x, VST 3.x, AU, RTAS and AAX Native on Mac And PC\

This effect is anywhere between a vocoder and a synth with sharp filter-sweeps.
It can use input audio for its timbre to act as a vocoder ("audio" mode) or use a spectrum which you can draw precisely with the mouse, allowing extremely sharp cutoffs. You can shift this timbre up or down based on pitch, velocity, or a per-note envelope ("sweep").
In "audio" mode, you can control how much audio is used to calculate the timbre (window) and how often (overlap). There is a zero-latency mode for live performance, and a latency-compensated one. The "Volume" section acts like a basic compressor - turn both dials to 0 to disable.

price = 65
description = """Pattern Strings offers a unique approach to ostinatos by providing a collection of tempo-synced rhythmic fragments.
These 19 rhythms have been recorded at two dynamic layers on violin, viola, cello, and bass, with 4 round robins.
The interface utilizes an intuitive drag and drop mechanic which allows you to arrange the rhythms into sequences in which all the rhythms flow together with natural phrasing and musicality.

You can Drag and Drop rhythms in the center to either of the pattern strips. If you want to change the order of the rhythms you can do that too, by dragging them around.

With Legato turned on, new notes start sync-ed with previous held notes. This way it's possible to create convincing lines by changing notes according to the rhythms, as seen in the demos.

Pattern Strings has an Automatic Bow Direction feature. It plays downbow samples on downbeats and upbow samples on upbeats, which creates a natural ebb and flow between beats.

The Tempo Sync switch allows you to set the sample playback to half speed or double speed.
Some of the samples were recorded at 90bpm, and others at 80bpm. So, let's say you're working at 160bpm. This would mean that the 90bpm samples would be time stretched to twice their original speed! To make up for this, you could use the Tempo Sync option to set the speed to be half as fast.

All the combinations of instruments have been rendered down, both single and with stereo doubling. This makes it possible to layer instruments together without so much memory and cpu.

Because Pattern Strings contains 8.32GB of samples, the interface was designed with a Dynamic Loading system so that it only loads what you need. In order to make it more efficient, combinations of instruments have been rendered together, saving on voice count and memory. This way if all instruments are enabled, it will use the same amount of memory and CPU as if only one instrument was enabled.

Beef up the sound of an instrument by turning on Doubling. Stereo-doubled samples have been rendered down, so turning this on won't increase the number of voices or memory needed.

Say you're using Pattern Strings on a track, and you have a couple of different variations you want to use at different parts of the track. Rather than opening up multiple instances, you could save variations into Custom Keyswitches.
Just click “Map”, then click on one of the colored keys at the very bottom of the keyboard, and Voilà, the current pattern can now be recalled by that key!

Generate a sequence of rhythms using the Random Button, and perhaps you will find something useful.\

description = """Sospiro Strings is a Kontakt library for creating slow, emotive strings. It features 4 different length swells and 3 sustained articulations, recorded on bass, cello, viola, and violin.

There are separate nki's for each individual instrument, and there is an nki with all instruments mixed together, to work as a simpler sketching tool, and also to save memory.
There are 2 varieties of Swells:

* The vibrato swells are provide a warm, individual sound. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option. All of the swells were originally recorded at 110 BPM
* The non-vibrato swells have a clear tone which especially brings attention to the change in tone as each instrument louder and softer.
Each version, Vibrato and non-vibrato has a single velocity layer. 

Using the Length in Beats slider, you can choose the appropriate length, and the corresponding swell will be chosen and time-stretched if needed.
The Length Multiplier is useful if you have a project with a fast bpm and you want it to sound slow, or vice versa.
The Smart Release feature makes it so that however far into the crescendo-ing part of the sample you have held the note, it will jump that far from the end of the swell. This means that the longer you hold a note, the longer its release will be.
All of the swells can be either vibrato or non-vibrato. The vibrato adds warmth and individuality to the sound, but may be a bit over dramatic in some cases. The non-vibrato has a lot of clarity, and especially brings attention to change in tone as each instrument gets louder and softer. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option.
The Sync feature is one of the most essential features: with Sync enabled, any notes you add or change in a chord will sync with the first note that was played.
There are 3 varieties of Sustains:

* The cold sustains are played with a slow bow and no vibrato --a fragile sound at the edge of breaking.
* The warm sustains are played over the fingerboard with a fast, freely changing bow and generous vibrato.
* The full sustains are played closer to the bridge with a slow, heavy bow. Vibrato is used with discretion.

There is an option to double the sound, which layers two instances together and pans them slightly apart. This sounds better if you are only using one instrument by itself and only playing a few notes at a time. If you are playing big chords and layering all 4 instruments together, the doubled feature tends to sound more generic and uninteresting.\

* The interface reacts to notes played, displaying what the music notation would look like to the player, and also showing which voicing, inversion, and key the chord is in. This could be an educational for those looking to write music for live musicians.
* Comes with a collection of midi clips to introduce the instrument. These include a collection of short progressions, and examples of all the possible voicings.
* Each chord was played for 4 measures (about 9 seconds). Loops are enabled for all samples.
* Automatically tempo-syncs to project tempo. The samples were recorded at 100BPM. 85 - 160BPM sounds good, and the optimal tempo is 120BPM.
* Chords are organized into 4 different types of voicings. Closed spacing, open spacing, 7th chords, and open 5ths.
* The closed spacing chords were recorded in both major and minor, and in all 3 inversions. The 7th chords include a dominant 7th, minor 7th, and major 7th voicing.
* Except for the open 5ths voicings, each chord recorded at 2 velocity layers, and each velocity layer has a normale version and a ponticello version, which can be crossfaded between using the modwheel. This is a good way to add motion to the sound.

The user interface holds tons of features on several pages to shape the sound the way you want it. However, if you do not feel like editing, just play and explore the 26 pre-programmed Key-Switch presets ranging from A-1 to A#1 on the lower keys of your MIDI-keyboard.
To achieve the feeling of a live performance, the user interface offers four "Dynamic Modes", „Key-Vibrato“, „Hot-Keys“ and a revolutionary new concept of articulation presets .
One of the most unique features in CH-Harmonica are the Phase-Aligned samples. After six months of research, Chris Hein found a solution to phase-synchronize the samples. This enables an absolutely perfect blending between six dynamic layers.
During the development of CH-Harmonica, most attention was spent on how to work with dynamic expression.

The Player

We were very happy when Berthold Matschat gave us permission to sample his rare harmonica. There are very few chromatic harmonica players worldwide, and he is the leading player in Germany. Berthold Matschat is also an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. Since he extensively works with sampled instruments in his own studio, he had a detailed concept of what needed to be played on and sampled of the harmonica.
His tone is particularly soulful and emotional. We recorded an old rare Hohner Harmonica, that dates back to those times, when Hohner could impress with the words “Made in Germany”.

The Cosmic Darkness

A journey into the future of sound turned dark and gritty fast. In Best Service - Dark Horizon, by Sonuscore, Elysion’s famous ensemble engine has been hijacked, augmented, and vaporized. With the drifting cosmic remains, Dark Horizon molds the future into a dystopian atmosphere of massive basses, cosmic arps, and drifting pads. Turn simple chords into unreal, nightmarish space-scapes, while moving the mod-wheel bends time and transports you into the dark, disparate corners of eldritch furies.

* Experience the diversity of 80 instantly playable, bass-heavy instruments.
* Experience the infinite depth of over 1.2GB of sample content.
* Experience the flexibility of 180 complex animated and fully customizable themes.

Dark Horizon is an earth-shattering bass-heavy synth built using synthesizers and a variety of sounds bent and warped into fascinating soundscapes and powerful low ends. Dark Horizon is built from the same engine as ELYSION, creating an even darker sound palette with new presets, themes, and effects. 

For Extraordinary and Dark Bass Sound

With a focus on dark, dirty bass sounds, Dark Horizon pushes levels and tones not yet explored by the Elysion series. Space engineer Tobias Menguser sent wavs into the far reaches of the cosmos, beyond the known universe, where only the terrifying nightmares and figments of reality lurk. In those unknown places, the sounds were twisted and experimented upon, crafting a full sound palette of dark and low basses. They mutated into growling instruments, screaming oscillations, and ground-shaking subs.
For Modern Producers and Score Composers
For ambient, modern electronic, and experimental music, Dark Horizon can bring a new power into your work with its library of grinds and grooves. For scoring and blockbusters, these sounds make for perfect tension-building underscore.
Dark Horizon  - What´s Included?
As the deep underbelly of the Elysion series, Dark Horizon is a powerful Kontakt instrument that resynthesizes orchestral sounds and sound FX along with a great variety of rare analog synths and FX boxes. The resulting instruments are mind-crushing sounds, gut-wrenching themes, rhythmic arps, whirling pads, and a set of effects to push them even further beyond the imagination.

* Ambient - Resynthesized - Cinematic - Dark Horizon pushes sounds into unrecognizable extremes, utilizing analogue rack effects and the dark powers of eldritch gods. Use Dark Horizon as a scoring tool for any project that needs a dose of profound bass and gritty depth or use it as a really exceptional synth to create innovative melodies with outstanding sonic power.
* Layered - Dirty - Powerful - With four layers of sounds and an onboard compressor, delay, and hall reverb, create unique and disturbing combinations for a truly original experience. Each layer is linked to an independent arpeggiator and two pan engines, allowing you to easily create complex, evolving pads.
* Sampling Redefined - Bursting with Expression and Variety - We recorded, sampled and produced the sounds, treating them like acoustic instruments. This results in an unimaginable dynamic and unprecedented sound. Integrated into the pathbreaking ensemble engine, Dark Horizon further expands our strongest composing lineup, together with Elysion 2 and The Orchestra.

Emotional Cello – never before, a virtual instrument could be played with this level of expression.

The Emotional Cello from the Munich-based developers Harmonic Subtones is a virtual instrument that features a powerful and emotional sound and opens up unknown dimensions of expression.
Whether film scoring, pop music productions, songwriting, classical music or modern, avant-garde cello compositions, the Emotional Cello shines through a variety of contained articulations, a direct and unadulterated sound as well as unusual playing techniques and rebowing.

Contextual Sampling

"Contextual Sampling" is what the developers of Emotional Cello call the philosophy behind this project in which all samples are always recorded in a musical context to capture the natural bowing and expressiveness of real instrumentalists. In this approach the recordings of a real vibrato play an important role, as they are always more inspiring and organic than adding an artificial vibrato.

Articulations, Patches & True Legato

Emotional Cello was created from well over 100 articulations and their variants. By means of an elaborate and intelligent script, countless articulations are linked together in a meaningful way so that they follow the playing style of the user.
The library contains three master patches, including the "Emotional Cello", the "Sulponticello" and the "Harmonic Cello". These contain most of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. Three different transition types have been captured in several sessions and simulate, among other things, realistic changes in bowing direction or passionate portamento while playing. The user simply controls the velocity - the tempo of the tone transitions automatically adapts to your DAW!
In addition to the Master Patch, the Emotional Cello also contains an Individuals Patch which is a set of key switch patches with different articulations of the same category such as sustains, shorts, trills and more. The Specials Patch offers some unusual articulations and effects and the Stackable Patch contains the main articulations with standardized key switching to match the stackable patches of Emotional Violin & Emotional Viola.

Selection of the included playing styles:
Spiccimo & frog, Stacc, Fast Spiccato, Frog Madness, Pizzicato, Delicate, Delicate fast, Proud Vibrato
Hero Vibrato, Martele half NV 8RR, Martele half Vib 4RR, Pickup, Fortepiano, Vivid, Paganini Run, Moderate 2, Sustain Non Vib XFDe, Expressive XFDe, Pastorale, Pastorale slow, Tremolo, Trill HAT,
Trill WT.

Ornament Key Switches

The Ornament Key Switches are another great feature. Unlike the articulation key switches, these are temporary and allow variations of the already selected articulation. By pressing one of the Ornament Key Switches, the current playing style can be faded into another articulation or variations can be generated. Last but not least, the Ornament MKS offer typical effects like glissando, flageolet and many more.

The Effects

In order to customize the sound of the Cello according to your wishes, you can use effects specially designed for the instrument. These include a 3-band EQ, a switchable sordino and a timbre function. The latter contains 15 convolution-based presets from renowned and experienced sound engineers for easy and characteristic modulation of the basic sound.
For the use of the Cello as 1st chair cello in an orchestral environment, there are also timbre EQs which place the viola in its correct position in the orchestra room. The final touch is provided by the "Room" and "Reverb" modules, which use professionally recorded convolution reverb presets to reproduce the sound of real rooms and can also be adjusted separately.

You are the artist!

The interface of the Emotional Cello has some advanced features to make it easier for you to play the library. For example, "PolyLegato" recognizes whether you are playing a bound melody line or a chord, and "Legato Trimming" allows you to manually adjust the speed of legato and portamento transitions.
The Attack function allows you to add an additional start sample independent of the currently selected articulation in order to let short notes flow in during legato playing or to simulate harsh starting notes. Correct tuning is also taken care of: Using the "Micro Tuning Option", the most popular tunings can be applied to the viola, and completely new tunings can be created.

The Recording

Emotional Cello was recorded in the Mastermix Studio near Munich, in a wood-panelled room with high ceilings and the greatest possible distance from the wall. For the greatest possible flexibility of use, two Neumann microphones, type KM184 and U87, were used for close recording. In this way, the room was kept quite subtle, and you can then create your desired sound with your own effects. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.

Emotional Violin - the most expressive virtual violin of all time

If you are looking for the perfect instrument for film scoring, pop music, songwriting, classical or modern avant-garde violin compositions, the Emotional Violin is your first choice! A unique, virtual instrument that convinces through its variety of articulations, its direct and unadulterated sound and functions like True Legato and Rebowing. With its impressive and at the same time emotional sound, it enables expressions that have never been achieved before.

Contextual Sampling

Our philosophy during the recordings is called "Contextual Sampling". In order to find the perfect sound, several string instruments were sampled in various ways over a period of four years. We came to the conclusion that no technique comes even close to the actual and natural vibrato of a trained musician. The samples of true legato were always much more inspiring and had a more organic feel than added artificial legato. So our goal was to perfectly capture these musical aspects and combine them into a great sounding and easy to play instrument.
Emotional Violin consists of more than 100 articulations and their variations. Through elaborate, intelligent scripting countless articulations were usefully linked, so that they follow the user’s style of playing. This is the secret of Emotional Violin that makes for its exceedingly realistic and authentic sound.

Master Patches & True Legato

Emotional Violin contains three Master Patches, including „Emotional Violin“ and „Intimate Violin“. These contain a multitude of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. In total, 3 different transition types were captured in countless sessions, which perfectly simulate bow changes or passionate portamento, easily controlled via velocity. The speed of the transitions automatically matches your DAW’s tempo.

Ornament Keyswitches

A special highlight are the Ornament Keyswitches. Unlike the articulation keyswitches, these are designed for the moment, to bring variations into chosen articulations. This way you can blend from a current playing style to another one (e.g. trills and tremolos) or you can generate variations (e.g. bow changes, to smoothly end a note), just by pushing an Ornament Keyswitch (e.g. trills and tremolos). Last but not least the Ornament MKS offer typical violin-effects like glissando (up and down), flageolett and many more.

Effective sound shaping

Emotional Violin offers a small but mighty collection of sound shaping possibilities, specifically tailored to the instrument. Aside from a typical 3-band EQ and a connectable sordino you will find timbre functions.
4 famous and experienced sound engineers created these convolution based presets (so called
Timbre Impulses) that allow for an easy and characterful modulation of the violin sound. To use the violin as 1st Chair Violin in an orchestral arrangement, we added a timbre EQ that places the violin in the correct orchestral seating. The icing on the cake are modules „Room“ and „Reverb“, which provide the sound of actual rooms, thanks to professionally recorded convolution presets - plus they can be tweaked separately.

You are the artist!

To meet the requirements of your playing, Emotional Violin offers additional features. At „Poly Legato“, for example, it automatically recognises whether a bound melody line or an chord is played and via „Legato Trimming“ you can manually set the speed of legato and portamento transitions. A speciality represents the attack feature, which enables the user to add a start sample independent of the selected articulation - for instance to add short or harsh starting notes during legato. The correct tuning is also provided: via the „Micro Tuning Option“ you can apply established tunings to the violin (e.g. pythagorean, Werkmeister III, and many more) or create entirely new ones.

The result is a library with unsurpassed authenticity

Emotional Violin offers a multitude of articulations - also unusual ones - you won’t find in any other library. Aside from the 3 big Master Patches, you will find more than 70 articulations structured in categories and available as Multi-Keyswitch-Patches - from expressive sustains, to pinpoint shorts with up 9 Round Robins, to trills and exotic effects, to dynamic crossfades within four layers. You can deactivate unused playing styles / keyswitches at any time via the „Purge“ feature, freeing up working storage for other instruments. So if you prefer to not work exclusively with keyswitches, this method perfectly suits you.
Simply select from one of the following
Normal Sustains with and without Vibrato, Multiple Progressive Vibratos, Multiple Espressivo, Flautando, Sul Ponticello, Morbid Sustains, Harmonics, Multiple Spiccatos, Staccato, Marcato, Tremolo, Tremolo Sul Ponticello, Multiple Trills, Pizzicato, Pizzicato Snap, Paganini Pizzicato, Scratches, Piazolla FX, Diverse Violin Effekte, Violin Percussions

The Recording

The Emotional Violin was recorded at the Mastermix Studio near Munich in a wood-panelled room with a large ceiling height and at the greatest possible distance to the wall. For maximum flexibility, two Neumann KM184 and U87 microphones were used very closely. Therefore the room amount is quite subtle, so you can use your own effects for further processing. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.
Kontakt Player 5.7.3 or higher required.
Emotional Violin is the second virtual instrument in this series, produced by Harmonic Subtones, the makers of Emotional Cello.\

The ultimate Sample-library for Ethnic Instruments from all over the World

ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the summit of a library that has continuously been growing and improving for over 16 years. In this sixth edition, numerous new instruments with a volume of several gigabytes have been added to the library.
Award-winning film composer Marcel Barsotti (e. g. Pope Joan, The Miracle of Bern) has gathered a gigantic selection of instruments from all over the word from widely varying cultures.
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments now consists of 264 instruments, with roughly 620 patches, 10 construction sets and 5 shaker sets. For the most authentic sound, the instruments were recorded with different play techniques that can easily and precisely be accessed from the patches via key-switches. The library consists of 24.7 gigabytes (uncompressed) of sample data and 23,559 samples. All instruments come in 24 bit and 44.1 kHz.
Over 70 musicians from all over world were involved in the recording process, conducted by music-producer Andreas Hofner. The recordings took place in different local studios with the use of first-class gear such as microphones by Neumann and Brauner, SPL preamplifiers and converters by RME.
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments comprises an incredible spectrum of instruments from the most diverse regions of Asia, Africa, Europe, North- and South-America. Here, you will find the perfect instruments for folkloric, ethnic as well as for modern music.
Library size ~ 15 GB (using Kontakt´s lossless compression)
Kontakt / Kontakt Player 5.6 or newer required!

INSTRUMENTS

The library contains an extensive selection of stringed, plucked and bowed instruments, as well as the most different woodwinds including numerous flutes and, of course, a large selection of drums and percussion.
Alongside film-score-proven taikos and big ethnic tom drums, there are hundreds of inspiring loops and even an entire "Gongs, Bells & Metal Type Instruments" category - ranging from the large big feng gong to delicately sparkling wind chimes. New in ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments are some unique sounds such as the two meter spanning gong by Paiste, several new percussion-instruments and a waterphone.
Almost all sections of the predecessor have been expanded once again. In addition, a couple of instruments of ETHNO WORLD 5 have been re-recorded. Among them is a new mandolin and a great sounding banjo, programmed with countless articulations and licks by one of Germany’s best banjo-players, Rüdiger Helbig.
Furthermore, you will now find a concertina, an autoharp, a Japanese koto, the aforementioned new mandolin with multiple play styles, a South-American charango, a bansuri, bass quena and an Indian flute plus additional play styles for the instruments launeddas, mancosedda, dvojacka and the Irish traverse flute.
With its selection of instruments, ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the perfect library for film- and television productions that demand authentic sounds from specific regions of the world. Naturally, these instruments will work in music productions of diverse genres that embrace these specific sonic elements - from pop to ambient to dance.

CONTENT

ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments contains all sounds of the previous versions, categorised in “Bowed Instruments”, “Stringed Instruments”, “Woodwind & Brass”, “Key Instruments”, “World Drums”, “World Percussion” and “Gongs, Bells & Metals”.
A good number of special instruments were additionally recorded for version 6. Among them is the new “Gamelan” category. The instruments were recorded in Munich's Stadtmuseum and contain two different gamelan orchestras from Bali and Java, available in slendro, pelog and international tunings. Here, you will find more than 25 instruments such as kempli, kendhang drums, cheng cheng, bells, kecer cymbals, kethuk and kempiang.
ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments also unlocks an entire new region by offering a complete ensemble of alpine folk music including plucked instruments, brass as well as male and female yodelers. Find instruments like the Styrian harmonica, a nylon stringed concert guitar, zither, raffele, dulcimer, alpenhorn, flugelhorn, trumpet, trombone, tuba, folk-violin and two clarinets. And of course it includes an acoustic bass.
For historical contexts, such as historic dramas or fantasy movies, ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments offers a large selection of medieval instruments, among them a hurdy gurdy, renaissance lute, fife, doucaine, shawm, pasalterium, pump organ and a shruti box. In a nutshell: every instrument for songs about fire and ice.

THE INTERFACE

ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments uses the free Kontakt 5 Player by Native Instruments as its sample-engine and can of course be used with the full version of Kontakt 5, too. For the new version, the user-interface's graphic has been completely redesigned and optimized for ultra fast access. There are numerous editing possibilities as well as innovative functions. ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments supports the Native Kontrol Standard (NKS), which allows tagging and interaction with the NI Komplete Kontrol keyboards and NI Maschine.
Further additions are a new waveform display, visualization of the sample-start-offset as well as a clearer use of the effects where, among other features, delay times are now displayed in tempo-related note values and milliseconds. The Timemachine (TM PRO) delivers significantly improved audio results with tempo adapted material, especially for polyphonic licks and loops.
And this is not only a benefit for the latest sounds of ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments but also for all sounds of ETHNO WORLD 5 which were completely revised in this regard. At the same time, the number of patches has been reduced, leading to a clearer menu structure.
Thanks to the integrated convolution reverb, all instruments sound exceptionally realistic and natural. Solo instruments additionally offer a high-quality legato mode. Plus, the humanize mode will play each new note with a slightly changed timbre. The micro-tuning allows the use of multiple ethnical tunings and scales. By using top-quality filters, LFOs, tune, automation, harmonizer and further effects, all instruments and voices can be efficiently edited and manipulated if needed - allowing to create new sonic worlds equally suited for modern music genres and film productions.
A unique feature of ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the integrated IDB-INFO (Information Database), being directly available from every instrument. Via the menu entry "IDB-INFO", you can access photos of the instruments as well as many details about their original play techniques and tunings, origins and variations. You will also find notes on how to use key-switches, achieving realistic results with the corresponding instrument. 

Vocal Expansion

In addition to ETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments, the separate dedicated vocal-library ETHNO WORLD 6 Voices is available. This library offers perfectly matching extensive solo-voices, phrases and choirs from Cameroon, Guinea, China, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Northern Africa, Spain and Ukraine. For version 6, the voices and choirs have been expanded by new contributions from Africa, Arabia, Jamaica and India.

Mystica – where world class vocalists meet the topmost innovative library designer and superior studio gear

With Mystica, Eduardo Tarilonte continues his incomparable series of vocal-libraries. This classical chamber choir consists of eight extraordinary female vocalists, delivering a unique, enchanting sound without comparison.
Mystica was designed as a female-choir-library for unconfined solo use. At the same time, the library forms a perfectly matched mixed choir when being combined with Cantus. Therefore, Mystica was recorded under identical conditions in spanish KBYO Recording Studios, located in Granada, using eight selected Neumann microphones and Avalon preamps.

Cantus cover

To ensure perfect team play of both libraries, Mystica offers the same words and Phrase-Arranger as Cantus. In addition, there is a new feature for quick-exchanging phrases and wordbuilder-settings between the libraries - in both directions. This way, the combination of Mystica and Cantus forms an impressive tool to create overwhelming choir passages.
Mystica is an unparalleled choir with an extraordinary sound quality. Mystica offers an almost magical sound which is extraordinarily versatile and equally suited for esoteric and mystic melodies as well as for big cinematic passages. One of the benefits of Mystica is its wonderful, expressive „True Legato“.

Mystica unifies realism and inspiration

This unrivaled choir-library allows creating incredibly realistic choir-phrases with ease. Mystica's powerful and innovative wordbuilder combines 24 words in the form of 120 elements, consisting of full words, corresponding syllables and five True-Legato vowels (A, E, I, O, U) plus an additional “Mmmh“-articulation.
As every Tarilonte vocal-library, Mystica offers the brilliant and innovative option of combining each word with any of the five True-Legato vowels, too. This way, realistically sounding vocal phrases can be created without using ready-made phrases.
Nevertheless, Mystica can, of course, be used as a typical choir-library without its Phrase-Arranger. There is an ample choice of 100 Gregorian vocal phrases, allowing to create sacral atmospheres with ease. In addition, the library offers twelve soundscapes being formed from vocal recordings as well as vocal effects to create unusual sounds.

Mystica Features:

* unique „Numen Ensemble“ female choir with eight vocalists
* 5 GB WAV samples, 24 bit/44.1 kHz
* 5 “True Legato” vowels (A, E, I, O, U), separate “Mmmh”-articulation
* powerful Phrase-Arranger with 24 words and three different articulations (staccato, fast, slow)
* words can be separated in 120 short words/syllables
* combine words with True-Legato vowels - automatic vowel selection
* 100 Gregorian vocal phrases
* 12 soundscapes, moulded from vocal recordings
* additional vocal effects
* new import/export functions to exchange Phrase-Arranger patches between Mystica and Cantus
* dry recordings, perfect to be spiced up with individual reverberation

The female choir selected by Tarilonte is the “Numen Ensemble”, founded 2011. This choir is formed by experienced and talented vocalists with broad vocal repertoire. Most singers have been or still are members of renowned ensembles such as the Baroque Sevilla Choir, the Choir of the Maestranza or the Choir of the City of Granada Symphonic Orchestra.\

The Orchestra Complete 3 - New Features - New Instruments - New Presets

"The Orchestra Complete 3" combines the powerful orchestration capabilities that have made "The Orchestra" recognized in the composition community with brand-new articulations and the most effective new features ever. Composing faster, more freely, and more uniquely has never been simpler.
The third version, which includes all three "The Orchestra" expansions, is filled with thrilling potential and power. Among them are "Horns Of Hell", which features a diabolical "evil brass" section, "Strings Of Winter", which features a 41-piece string orchestra and captures the wild spirit of nature, and "Woods Of The Wild", which re-energizes the woodwinds to catch all that is evocative in their breath.
In addition to  these expansions comes the all-in-one package of the base orchestra, a top-quality-recorded 80-piece orchestra with a massive array of articulations and a groundbreaking ensemble engine that has been rebuilt and expanded upon. It's now simpler than ever to turn your ideas into music.

What´s Included?

"The Orchestra Complete 3" extends our entry-level instrument "The Orchestra" with more instruments, more presets and extended powerful features. Now including:

* Woods Of The Wild - Complete and extended woodwind section with impressive articulations like triple tongues and rips and trills. Also included are mallets, other wooden drums, and percussion.
* Horns Of Hell - More than 65 expressive brass articulations and 120 incredible and powerful presets, including a full Organ library.
* Strings Of Winter - 60 string articulations, two new ethnic string sections and all additional content from Strings Of Winter.
* Sequence Designer - In addition to the default options, you can create your own unique musical patterns. You have the option to change each of these sequences separately, which gives you the ability to make more intricate compositions.
* Pure Performance Legato - We are pleased to present a powerful legato engine that has undergone a complete redesign. Because the engine can differentiate between the two articulations without the use of keyswitches, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any hassles.
* Main Page: Voicing Selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or choose from over 90 pre-arranged Voicings. The Ensemble Engine is just like having a real-life orchestrator working for you.
* Additional presets and multi-instruments - Discover how the Voicings (208 presets), Rhythms (239 presets), and Animated Orchestra settings (223 presets) work with the 5-part arranging engine by exploring the presets to get the most out of "The Orchestra Complete 3". Updated Voicings that use and bring together the expanded libraries in innovative and expressive ways are also included in "The Orchestra Complete 3".
* MIDI Export - "The Orchestra Complete 3" comes with MIDI-Export. Patterns and arrangements generated by the engine can be exported onto separate MIDI Tracks, opening endless possibilities.

The Core – The Ensemble Engine

The Ensemble Engine works through a number of independent arpeggiators and velocity envelopes, heavily inspired by the Sonuscore Origins-Series.

Create Complex Arrangements With Simple Chords

Create pulsating rhythms and inspiring full arrangements with simple chords and without the use of any pre-recorded phrases. At the heart of "The Orchestra Complete 3" is the Ensemble Engine, which allows this inspiring dance of instruments and rhythms to unfold before your very eyes with only the press of a chord.

* 3 independent arpeggiators and 2 velocity envelopes can be assigned to create vivid and powerful orchestral voicings
* Create and customize your own patterns through the sequencer designer.
* Load up to 5 different instruments in independent slots and play them together.
* Every slot can be assigned to one of five different modules.
* Assign percussion to the arpeggiator to create pulsating rhythms.
* Voicings selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or you can choose from our 90+ pre-arranged Voicings.

Compose Faster with Full Instrumental Groups

Choose from nearly 700 Presets in Three Categories.

* Orchestral Voicings - Orchestral Voicings include various playable arrangements of instruments that create the fullest and richest orchestral sound.
* Orchestral Rhythms - Orchestral Rhythms presets bring you cinematic and expressive rhythms that take full advantage of the Ensemble Engine.
* Animated Orchestra - Making full use of all the possibilities of the Ensemble Engine, the Animated Orchestra presets are for the most complex and magical musical ideas.

Export Your Custom Performance

Drag and drop MIDI to your DAW. Once you have been inspired by a preset or have created your own complex arrangement, drag and drop your passage right from the Kontakt orchestra nki to your DAW. Unleash the power of the Customizer Engine onto your personal template, change notes, combine different patterns, and make them your own.

Take Full Control Over The Ensemble

Work quickly and intuitively with our straightforward user interface.
On the Engine page you can access all individual controls for each of the five instrument modules. Short notes can be arranged with the arpeggiators, while sustained notes can be shaped with the velocity envelope. Create the orchestral colors as you need them and let the magic happen.

* Arpeggiator - The arpeggiator creates fascinating melodic patterns to give your project a rich and lively orchestral feeling. Change the pattern of the arpeggiator with the rhythm stepper. If needed, you can modify almost every parameter to stay in full control of your orchestral voicing.
* Sequence Designer - The Sequence Designer is included in the arpeggiator. This allows you to create in detail your own musical passages. Instead of following the specific styles of preset arpeggios, create your own and make it as complex as you’d like.
* Velocity Envelope - Shape your sustain sounds with the Velocity Envelope, adding to your sound a recurring dynamic movement from a sustained note. The centerpiece is the envelope shape, which can be drawn freely.

Play Over 280 Instruments / Articulations Freely

Create full and detailed orchestrations from scratch. Play your ideas and your melodies freely with countless single instruments. Included are all standard sections and articulations from a symphonic orchestra, including percussion as well as tonal percussion (Marimbaphone, Vibraphone, Xylophone and Glockenspiel) and as a bonus: choir, piano, cembalo, celesta and a massive church organ.

Pure Performance Legato

With our Pure Performance Legato technology, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any problems, as the engine can distinguish between both articulations without the need for keyswitches. Special attention was paid to the integration of the true legato transitions, fitting each of the more than 400 transitions per instrument independently into the intervals in a way that allows for a very smooth and playable legato.

Ensemble-Multi Patches: Unleash The Full Orchestral Power

Multis take the Ensemble Engine even further toward instant playability and epic sound as they load and layer multiple instances of "The Orchestra". The easiest way to create complex orchestral arrangements.
There are full playable orchestral multis for single articulations that work perfectly for quick sketching and layering. Orchestral Rhythm and Animated Orchestra Multis combine multiple instances of the Ensemble Engine to create even more complex patterns.

The Samples: Rough, Unpolished And Human

"The Orchestra" was recorded and processed with the intention to sound a bit rougher and more “honest” than the common Hollywood-sounding orchestra vst. It offers an alternative and promises straight and powerful sounds, punch and a vivid musical experience.
The instruments for "The Orchestra" were recorded in Budapest at the renowned Studio 22 in their traditional seating position and mixed and edited with great attention to detail. This way the different sections blend together perfectly in the same room. All essential articulations are available, including playable true legato samples and multiple round robins for short articulations.

Preset Browser

The updated preset browser is available for "The Orchestra Complete 3", "Strings Of Winter", "Horns Of Hell" and "Woods of the Wild". Explore the massive selection of presets using intuitive filters and categories.

Choose Your Favorite Interface Design

"The Orchestra Complete 3" by default loads each instrument in the appropriate design. If you prefer a different design, you can switch it anytime via the instrument settings.

Key Features

* Breakthrough Ensemble Engine
* Play freely or create stunning orchestral colors with simple chords
* Complete set of standard articulations for all instruments
* True Legato Interval Sampling
* 670 ready-to-go ensemble presets

Ambient Black is the second of a linked pair of sound design-based virtual instruments designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original instruments and textures suitable for all sorts of ambient music.

As its name implies, Ambient Black covers the darker end of the ambient spectrum, focusing on harsh, aggressive, atonal, mysterious, and industrial sounds. Ambient White, the first VI in this series, covers the opposite end of the ambient spectrum.

The majority of sounds used in the creation of Ambient Black were derived from organic sources: found sounds and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques, prepared and heavily processed musical instruments, and sounds recorded in natural environments. The synth sounds were also processed with sound design techniques, and combined with various organic sounds and instruments.

The end result is a product that combines acoustic, human, industrial, and electronic elements to produce an organic-sounding virtual instrument.

THE INSTRUMENT PATCHES

Ambient Black features over 280 different instrument patches and combinations (over 6.5 GB of uncompressed WAV data), divided into seven categories:

1. Multi-Layered Instruments
2. Drones & Atmospheres
3. Bass Instruments
4. Percussive Instruments
5. Melodic Instruments
6. Looped Instrument Phrases
7. Effects & Textures

The most complex instrument patches in Ambient Black are the Multi-Layered Instruments, created using combinations of patches from the other six categories. These patches are organized by their basic type, using the following prefixes:

* ATMOS: Layered Atmospheres and Pads
* BASS: Layered Bass Instruments
* FX: Layered Effects & Textures
* LOOP: Layered Looped Phrases
* MELO: Layered Melodic Instruments
* PERC: Layered Percussive Instruments

MULTI-LAYERED INSTRUMENT PATCHES

Many of the Multi-Layered Instrument patches consist of multiple evolving atmospheres, effects, textures, and looped phrases. For the best results, try playing these patches with one finger, or in octaves. This suggestion doesn't apply to Layered PERC patches, which in general don't have any pronounced melodic or harmonic content; playing multiple notes at a time with these layered patches can produce some interesting polyrhythmic patterns.

EFFECTS & TEXTURES

The Effects & Textures category includes a number of strange and aggressive sounds that were primarily designed to be used as cinematic sound design elements. Most don't have an identifiable pitch or key-center, and can be used as drones.

PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic, industrial, and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of cinematic hits, glitches, industrial sounds, and other unusual percussive sounds.

DRONES & ATMOSPHERES

Many of the Drones & Atmospheres are long and evolve over time. Try holding a key for 10, 20, or even 30 seconds, and listen to how each of these sounds develop. Because most of these sounds are huge and dense, try playing just single notes or octaves.

MELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS

The Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as pads.

LOOPED INSTRUMENTS

The Looped Instruments include simple repeating patterns and some complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Some loops do not lock to tempo intentionally in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches. Looped Instruments should be played like the Drones & Atmospheres, using solo notes or octaves for less-complex patterns and different intervals for more experimental and harmonically-dense effects.\

2. Pads & Atmospheres
3. Melodic Instruments
4. Percussive Instruments
5. Bass Instruments
6. Looped Instrument Phrases
7. Effects & Textures

The most complex instrument patches in Ambient White are the Multi-Layered Instruments, which were created using combinations of patches from the other six categories. These patches are arranged by their basic type, using the following prefixes:

* ATMOS: Layered Atmospheres and Pads
* BASS: Layered Bass Instruments
* FX: Layered Effects & Textures
* LOOP: Layered Looped Phrases
* MELO: Layered Melodic Instruments
* PERC: Layered Percussive Instruments

MULTI-LAYERED INSTRUMENT PATCHES

Many of the Multi-Layered Instrument patches consist of multiple evolving atmospheres, chordal and/or melodic components, and/or looped phrases. For best results, try playing these patches with one finger, in octaves, or in fifths. This doesn't apply to Layered PERC patches, which in general don't have any pronounced melodic or harmonic content; playing multiple notes at a time with these Layered patches can produce some interesting polyrhythmic patterns.

EFFECTS & TEXTURES

The Effects & Textures category includes a number of patches that were mainly designed to work in tandem with other types of patches. These patches were designed with that in mind.

PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of tuned hand drums, cymbals and gongs, and other percussive sounds.

PADS & ATMOSPHERES

Many of the Pads & Atmospheres also include chordal components. When trying these patches for the first time, it's probably best to play them with one finger or in octaves. You can then experiment with playing different intervals, depending on the level of harmonic complexity you're looking for.

MELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS

The Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also few have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as Pads.

LOOPED INSTRUMENT PHRASES

The Looped Instrument Phrases include simple repeating patterns and some more-complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Many of the loops lock to tempo, but some do not; this was done intentionally, in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches. Looped Instrument Phrases should be played like the Pads & Atmospheres, using solo notes or octaves for less-complex patterns and different intervals for more experimental and harmonically-dense effects.\

Vintage Rhythm Section is a virtual instrument for Kontakt 5 designed to emulate the classic rhythm section sounds of R&B, Soul, Funk, Jazz, and Rock records from the 1960's and 1970's.

Vintage Rhythm Section (VRS) is easy to use, with a simple interface that lets you work quickly and intuitively. If you're producing retro or indie-style music on a budget, or if you're a TV or film composer working on a tight deadline, VRS can be used to create live-sounding drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, and percussion tracks.

CAPTURING THAT VINTAGE RHYTHM SECTION SOUND

Like its sister-products, Vintage Horns and Vintage Strings, Vintage Rhythm Section was not designed to be a shiny, perfect-sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way rhythm sections sounded back in the 60's and 70's, including some of the minor imperfections that added character to those instruments and made them sound so good.

For VRS, we sampled a large collection of vintage instruments - some amazingly still in mint condition, and others looking every bit as "vintage" as you'd expect a piece of 40-50 year-old gear to look.

Wherever possible, we used the same types of amps and mics that were used in the 60's and 70's. Some of this old gear was pretty funky-sounding, which probably would have disqualified it from being used on most other types of sample libraries. But for VRS, it was just what we were looking for.

VRS features two easy-to-use GUIs:

1) A 12-channel mixer for drums
2) The main GUI, which is used for all of the keyboards, basses, and guitars.

THE DRUM MIXER

- Reverb Select: This is a drop-down menu that allows you to select various types of convolution IRs.
- Channel Strips: Each offers controls for Treble, Bass, Reverb Amount, Pan, and Solo/Mute. Note that not all kits have the same number of toms and cymbals. Instead, each kit was custom-built to fit the musical genre and era it came from.
- Master Channel: Allows you to add tape saturation (SAT) and/or compression (COMP) to the entire kit.

THE MAIN GUI

From top to bottom and left to right, this GUI has the following controls:

- TAPE SAT adds tape-style saturation/compression
- TREBLE adds or cuts high end
- BASS adds or cuts low end
- DISTORTION SWITCH - use this to turn the effect on or off
- DISTORTION adds amp-style distortion
- DELAY controls the amount of tape-style delay
- DELAY SELECT allows you to choose from several types of delay
- ROTATOR SWITCH turs Leslie-style effect on or off
- ROTATOR allows you to select the speed of the Leslie-effect
- REVERB controls the amount of reverb added
- REVERB SELECT allows you to choose from a selection of high-quality Convolution Reverbs designed to replicate a number of vintage amp-reverbs and recording spaces
- MOD-WAH SWITCH turns on your controller's Mod Wheel as a wah-wah pedal

Key-Switches

Key-switching is a function that allows the user to quickly change from one articulation to another. If an instrument has any key-switch options, it will have red keys located on the far left of the Kontakt virtual keyboard. Many of the basses and guitars offer key-switched long and short (sustain and staccato) articulations, and some of the keyboards offer different key-switched presets.\

Vintage Strings is a virtual instrument for Kontakt 5 designed to emulate the classic violin string section sounds of R&B, Soul, and Funk records from the 1960's and 1970's. Whether you're an experienced arranger or casual producer, Vintage Strings was designed to make it quick and easy for you to create great sounding string tracks for your productions. Like its sister product, Vintage Horns, Vintage Strings was not designed to be a shiny, perfect sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way string sections sounded back in the '60s and '70s; including the decidedly not classical playing style and minor imperfections that added character to those sections and made them sound so good.

For Vintage Strings we recorded a 6 piece violin section using vintage Neuman U-87 mics and Royer ribbon mics run through a great sounding SSL board. To capture a true vintage string sound, we used close mics, room mics, and string section positioning based on actual session notes from old Motown and Philly Soul recording sessions. Rather than record the violins in a magnificent concert hall or some other large and resonant recording space, we recorded our players in a funky old studio with a smaller, less-reverberant room that had characteristics similar to the rooms used to record classic Soul and R&B records. Using the tracks we recorded in this space, we then created three types of sections:

2 VIOLINS:

The 2VLN patches are very useful for creating the sound of smaller string sections. Even if played in 3-part harmony, these patches sound like a 6 piece section, rather than a full orchestral string section. The 2VLN patches take up a lot less sonic space in the mix, and also have the advantage of sounding like the smaller types of string sections used on a lot of old Soul and R&B records, which didn't have the time or budget to record a larger section.

6 VIOLINS:

The 6VLN patches are great for recording unison (1 part) lines that emulate the sound of a true 6 violin section, which was very commonly used in many old Soul recordings. When used for 2-part harmonies or octaves these patches can be used to replicate the sound of an overdubbed 6 violin section (i.e., a faux 12 violin section), which was a very common recording technique used on many Motown recording sessions.

12 VIOLINS:

The 12VLN patches are very useful for creating unison (1 part) string lines that sound like an overdubbed 6 violin section. If you want to get a bigger sound with the size of a larger orchestral string section, without the color and character present in a large recroding hall or symphonic space, use the patches for string parts in 2 or 3 part harmonies.

The result is a virtual instrument that has a sound and character that is distinctly different from orchestral based sampled string libraries. The sound of Vintage Strings is intentionally not big, rich, and glossy. It's a smaller, more intimate, and more "human" sound, which more accurately emulates the string sound on those classic old records.

FAST AND EASY STRING SECTION PARTS USING PRE-SET PATCHES

If you don't have a lot experience writing for strings, or even if you're an experienced string-arranger on a tight deadline, Vintage Strings also offers a number of pre-programmed instrument patches that can help you quickly create great sounding string parts. These include the Tonal Harmonization Patches, which contain 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part patches for 2, 6, and 12 violins. Playing with just one finger on your keyboard you can easily write string lines in 2 parts (intervals), 3 parts (triads), or 4 parts (seventh chords). Secondly, the Tonal Harmonization patches include Fixed Chord & Interval Patches containing 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part Chord Patches, for 2, 6, and 12 violins. These patches are programmed to play a specific interval or chord according to the type of patch in 12 different keys.

THE VINTAGE STRINGS GUI

The Vintage Strings graphical user interface (GUI) is very simple and easy to use. The main page of the interface includes control over tape saturation, high EQ, and reverb with 15 custom selected convolution reverbs.

THE HARMONIZE PAGE

On the Harmonize page you can choose the key and scale of the interval or chord-based preset patches, or create custom interval and chord-based patches of your own.

Zodiac is a unique-sounding Virtual Instrument designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original sounds and instruments suitable for film or TV scores, video games, and all types of ambient and experimental music.

No synthesizers were used to create the instruments in Zodiac. Instead, all instruments were created from organic sources such as found sounds, sonic manipulations inspired by classic Musique Concrete, Experimental and Avant Garde Music compositions, prepared or heavily processed musical instruments, and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques.

Zodiac features over 200 patches and Multis (over 8GB of uncompressed wav data), divided into six categories:

* Pads & Atmospheres
* Melodic Instruments
* Bass Instruments
* Percussive Instruments
* Experimental Instruments
* Zodiac Kits

Zodiac's instruments range from beautiful and ethereal soundscapes to wildly inventive percussion and mysterious, haunting, atonal and experimental sounds that defy easy categorization. Search through Zodiac's patch folders, and you won't find anything like a regular bass, guitar, keyboard, or drum set. Instead, you'll find a collection of sounds that are quite unlike those made by any standard instrument.

Not only does Zodiac feature a constellation of ready-to-use instrument patches, it's also a powerful sound-design VI. Use Zodiac's simple but versatile controls to dramatically alter, sculpt, or tweak and customize sounds to fit your individual style. However, you don't even need to touch a single control to get a variety of sounds from Zodiac's preset patches.

Zodiac is made for experimentation: hold down a key on many instrument patches and a sound loops and morphs, revealing surprising musical timbres and harmonic strata. Play an instrument one way and it has a percussive quality; play it another, and the notes expand into a pad or atmosphere. Play a patch in one octave and it sounds dreamy and surreal; play it in another octave and it behaves and sounds quite differently.

No matter what soft synths, sound modules, or VIs you already own, Zodiac will expand the palette of sounds in your sonic tool box and add a unique character to your music.

The Zodiac GUI

Despite its somewhat enigmatic appearance, Zodiac's Graphic User Interface (GUI) is quite simple to use. Here's the key:

The Control Banks

ON either side of the Zodiac logo is a control bank consisting of SIX levers. Under each lever is a single letter, which stand for the following:

(Lefthand Bank)

AMP ENV - Amp Envelope controls:

A - Attack
D - Decay
S - Sustain
R - Release

T - Tuning (Pitch)
R - Reverb amount

(Righthand Bank)

DELAY - the Delay controls:

T - Delay Time
D - Delay Damping
P - Dealy Panning
F - Delay Feedback

B - Bass
T - Treble

The Levers

Note that the four white-tipped levers on either side represent a grouping of related controls, and have a range of 0 to 10.

Note also that the red-tipped levers represent controls not related to the white groups, and that three of these have a range from -10 to +10.

Use command-click (MAC) or control-click (PC) to return any of the levers to the default setting of zero.

The Reverb Window

The window below the Zodiac logo contains a drop-down menu, with a list of fifteen very different-sounding Convolution Reverb IRs. Click on this window if you'd like to change the type of reverb on the instrument being played. Note that the R(everb) lever to the left of the window controls the amount of reverb.

Zodiac is powered by the industry-leading Kontakt engine. It is compatible with VST, AudioUnit, AAX (Pro Tools 10) and RTAS (Pro Tools 9 & 10) plug-in formats allowing it to work seamlessly within any major sequencer, in addition to standalone use.

- Over 150 different instrument patches and 50 Multis
- Six Categories: Pads & Atmospheres, Melodic Instruments, Bass Instruments, Experimental Instruments and Zodiac Kits
- 4.6 GB (over 8 GB uncompressed)
- Kontakt Player 5.2.1 included\

Handbell V2 Sampled Articulations -

Handbell Clapper - samples are created with the traditional technique of holding it against the shoulder, bell-upwards, and then swinging the bell through an elliptical shape to cause the clapper to strike the casting of the bell.

Suspended Handbell with a soft rubber mallet - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a soft rubber mallet.

Suspended Handbell with a hard rubber mallet - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a hard rubber mallet.

Suspended Handbell with a plastic chopstick - samples were recorded with the bells suspended from the ceiling of the room while being struck with a plastic chopstick. This creates a great deal of high frequency content for a special effect.

Singing Handbells - The Singing Handbells sound is created by running a wood dowel along the rim of the handbell, similar to the way you can run a wet finger along the edge of a crystal glass and make it sing.

Plucked Handbells - is accomplished by using the thumb and forefinger to force the clapper head into the casting while the bell is on the table, producing a staccato note.

Malleted Handbells on a padded table - samples are created by striking the bell with a rubber mallet while the bell is resting on the foam of a padded table. This produces a tone brighter and more percussive than the plucked samples.

Handbell Shakes - is accomplished by quickly ringing the bell back and forth so that the clapper strikes both the front and back of the bell casting in rapid succession. This creates a continuous sustained tone.

Martellato (mart) - this articulation is created when the handbell is rung by holding it by the handle and gently striking the full body of the handbell horizontally on the padded table.

Martellato Lift (mart-lift) - is the above Martellato articulation followed by immediately lifting the handbell from the table to allow the bell to continue to ring.\

CSP features a beautiful Yamaha C7 Grand, recorded in Australia’s premiere scoring stage. Great care went into capturing the full dynamic range of the instrument, with the pedal up and down. We also captured the incidental key and pedal noises that occur during a real performance, adding greater authenticity to the sound.

STRAIGHTFORWARD AND REALISTIC

Like the rest of the Cinematic Studio Series, CSP features a no-nonsense GUI, which is easy to learn so you can get straight to work. Four microphone channels, controlled via the mixer, provide the perfect combination of detail and ambience. We also included a variety of scrapes, glissandos and plucks in an FX patch, perfect for adding tension to a score. The output routing feature makes it easy to sculpt your own sound, and the modest resource footprint means you can comfortably add it to any project.

Cinematic Studio Piano is recorded in the same world-class scoring stage as Cinematic Studio Strings, and is the perfect piano accompaniment to the rest of the series. With an integrated high quality reverb, multiple microphone positions and carefully recorded key and pedal noises, CSP’s intuitive GUI and real-life sound make it an invaluable addition to your orchestral template.\

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO STRINGS

CSS features a Hollywood-style string section, recorded in position in Australia’s premiere scoring stage – Trackdown. From the soaring colourful vibrato of the high violins to the dark and woody textures of the low cello and bass notes, you’ll be instantly inspired. Our aim was to create an instrument that’s instantly playable, sounds great out-of-the-box and is backed up by speedy customer support.

GROUNDBREAKING INTERFACE

At the heart of CSS is its cutting edge GUI, building on our previous critically-acclaimed library Cinematic Strings 2. This means a short-but-sweet patch list, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. These features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page, you’ll have CSS working alongside you on your latest project within minutes.

REALISTIC AND EXPRESSIVE

CSS features a stunningly realistic legato engine. We painstakingly recorded true legato transitions for each note, up and down, including a beautiful portamento. We also recorded ‘re-bow’ samples, meaning you can play repeated legato notes smoothly and with true-legato realism. Please check out the Legato Introduction video below. NEW: Powerful marcato articulation allows you to  create highly realistic runs with ease.

LIVE SOUND, NO REVERB REQUIRED

With smooth legato, punchy spiccatos, inspiring textural harmonics and con sordino, CSS covers a wide range of the sound palette afforded by a world-class string section. We’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound, so you’ll feel like you’re at a live session. With this new level of realism, you’ll feel comfortable using CSS without reverb; in fact, we recommend it! All of our demos were created without reverb – all you hear is the natural air captured in the samples.

FULLY MIXED - LOAD AND PLAY

We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record CSS at three distances, which you can combine to create your own unique mix either inside Kontakt or via the newly included output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our pre-mixed combination of all 3 if you want a great sound with fewer resources. Full and Lite Ensemble patches optimise workflow and are perfect for sketching or filling out a track.

NEW! CINEMATIC STUDIO WOODWINDS

Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is the latest addition to the Cinematic Studio Series collection. Whether you want to blow the roof off with the bright penetrating sound of the piccolo, express emotion with the beautiful lyrical oboe, or vibrate the floor with the deep and powerful bass clarinet, these superb instruments bring warmth and vitality to your orchestral template. They perfectly complement the rest of the series: the Strings, Solo Strings, Brass and Piano.

INTUITIVE, EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE

At the heart of Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is its intuitive and efficient GUI. This means one patch per instrument, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. To save memory, articulations can be loaded in or out of RAM with a couple of clicks. As the layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings and Brass, these features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page.

BROAD PALETTE — SOLOISTS AND SECTIONS

To record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds we used a marvellous selection of top-tier players to capture the full range and character of each of nine solo instruments and four sections. Whether you want the fine detail of a soloist, or the warm collaborative synergy of our two-player sections, we recorded the full dynamic range to harness both nuance and power. Every instrument was treated equally, including the piccolo, cor anglais, alto flute, bass clarinet and contrabassoon.

VERSATILITY AND REALISM

CSW features a range of articulations including playful short notes, expansive textures with flutter-tongue and trills, and a stunningly realistic legato engine. We spent countless hours recording true long-form legato transitions for each note, resulting in unparalleled realism. Because we’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound you’ll feel like you’re in the room with the players. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure a delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism.

FULLY MIXED — LOAD AND PLAY

We used a variety of beautiful ribbon and condenser microphones to record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds at four mic distances: Close, Overhead, Main and Room, which you can combine to create your own mix inside Kontakt or via the output-routing option. Alternatively, you can use our ready-to-go mix position that contains all four mics in a stereo mix if you want a great sound with fewer resources. A Full Ensemble patch will be released as an update in the near future.

INTRODUCING CINEMATIC STUDIO BRASS

Cinematic Studio Brass brings a powerful Hollywood-style brass section to your fingertips and is the newest addition to our Cinematic Studio Series. We spent nearly 300 hours recording in a world-class scoring stage, using a unique combination of microphones to capture the individual character and charm of each instrument. The result is a stunning package of playable, realistic brass instruments; CSB stands out from the crowd either on its own, or as a perfect complement to Cinematic Studio Strings.

INTUITIVE SCRIPTING, EASY TO USE GUI

The GUI is streamlined and efficient, with its minimal number of patches making it quick to learn and easy to use. The layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings, so of course it’s easy to work with on its own, or equally easy when using both libraries together. The GUI features easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. To save memory, articulations can be loaded in or out of RAM with a couple of clicks.

DETAILED SOLOISTS, POWERFUL SECTIONS

Cinematic Studio Brass is a highly versatile library, capable of bringing you the sweet sounds of a gentle melody, or packing a real punch to bring all the drama and impact of a real Hollywood brass section to your music. We recorded the full dynamic range across every instrument, so when you play hard, you’ll hear hard – thanks to our talented players giving their all in every session. There’s nothing like hearing a brass ensemble really bring a room to life, and that’s exactly the sensation we’ve captured here.

UNRIVALED REALISM AND CONSISTENCY

We’ve broken new ground here with our smooth and powerful legato and marcato articulations. Long-form legato was captured across the entire dynamic range – the result of countless hours of recordings and retakes. You’ll be swept away by the level of realism we’ve achieved. In addition the legato scripting has been upgraded with further under-the-hood functionality, so sculpting new melodic phrases is easier than ever. As always, we’ve maintained the highest possible level of consistency across all instruments to give them all a similar feel on the keyboard.

PRESENTING CINEMATIC STUDIO SOLO STRINGS

Cinematic Studio Solo Strings is the perfect complement to Cinematic Studio Strings. CSSS brings you solo violins 1 and 2, viola and cello to add a tantalising new dimension to your musical creations. We spent more than 120 hours recording Australia’s finest string players in a world-class scoring stage, using a unique combination of microphones to capture the individual character and charm of each instrument. The result is a stunning package of playable, realistic solo strings that stands out from the crowd either on their own, as an exquisite quartet, or as first chair for the full-section strings.

INTUITIVE, EASY TO USE GUI

The GUI is streamlined and efficient, with a minimal number of patches making it quick and easy to learn. The layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings, so you can double the solo instrument patches with their section counterparts (eg Solo Violin I with 1st Violins), and play them at the same time on one MIDI channel. This first-chair functionality serves to reinforce the sound of each section, with the lush sound of the section bolstered by a 1st-chair solo patch. This blending together of the two libraries creates an even smoother, richer sound.

VIRTUOSO SOLO, QUARTET OR FIRST CHAIR

Cinematic Studio Solo Strings brings all the emotional depth and virtuosity of an outstanding quartet to your fingertips, making it the perfect compositional tool for exposed lyrical solo or quartet passages. And because we maintained positional accuracy and recorded the same diverse range of articulations, CSSS provides a vibrant first-chair accompaniment to our full section library Cinematic Studio Strings. This allows you to seamlessly transition between writing for solo strings and full sections.

UNPARALLELED REALISM

Cinematic Studio Solo Strings are expressive, emotive and powerful, with a smooth realistic sound that gives any melody that elusive human touch. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure that delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism. All of the dynamics have been preserved in their natural state, and as with CSS, no EQ or reverb was applied to the demos, so what you hear is the pure, out-of-the-box sound.

COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ARTICULATIONS

Cinematic Studio Solo Strings features a comprehensive list of playing articulations and styles, including true long-form legato for enhanced realism, portamentos and marcato. There is an excellent range of short notes, as well as tremolos, trills, and col legno. The articulation list, dynamic layers and keyswitch layout of the library match Cinematic Studio Strings in order to provide  a perfect first-chair accompaniment.

Equinoxe is a virtual analogue synthesizer for Windows only from the English developer SuperWave based on the Ultimate synthesizer and made for recreating the works of Jean Michel Jarre. It has two oscillators, an arpeggiator, effects (delay, limiter with drive, phaser, chorus tone control and reverb) and an envelope generator with DADSR (decay-attack-decay-sustain-release). Its first oscillator can also function as the Ultimate Oscillator which has a total of 16 fully programmable oscillators which can be stereo spread, detuned and synced separately. Oscillator 1 waveforms include Ultimate Osc, Tri Sync Osc, Noise, Triangle, Sf2 Exp and Saw. Oscillator 2 waveforms are Saw, Square, Noise, Perc and Triangle. The arpeggiator of Equinoxe handles both classic and phrase arpeggiation with modes such as Down/Back, Up/Forward, Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 (note: Alt meaning 'alternative'). The sequencer of Equinoxe is a 4 X 32 step sequencer (meaning that it has got 4 32-step sequencers). In each sequence, parameters such as position and modulation parameters can be edited. The sequencer supports the playing modes Forward and Reverse. The synthesizer also has two low frequency oscillators (LFOs). Equinoxe has two filters: a state-variable filter of -12 dB/-24 dB and a Moog filter (for the creation warm, vintage sounds). The Equinoxe comes bundled with Cubase projects and MIDI files to demonstrate the features of it. The songs "Magnetic Fields 2" and "Equinoxe 4" are supplied with the demo version and 12 additional tracks are supplied with the plugin when it is purchased from the author. Additionally, the SuperWave Drums Bundle, containing the SuperWave drum modules D-808, D-909 and Tiny Pops, is also provided free of charge. The plugin comes with 192 presets including basses, leads, strings, pads and sound effects. The presets of Equinoxe include "Oxygene 4 Lead 1", "Oxygene 4 Lead 2", "MFields 2 Lead 1", "FX Bird Tweets" and "FX Wind Fade 4". A feature worth mentioning is that Equinoxe also comes with an initialize bank, containing preset probrams (both fxb and fxp formats) for all the waveforms, including the Ultimate Oscillator waveforms such as Ramp and Soft Ramp. This way, it is easier (also for a blind user) to change the waveform of Equinoxe from one to another. After registering the plugin, it might happen that it won't play when trying to play with the synthesizer. This occurs due to the safety features introducet with Windows. To fix this problem, the digital audio workstation (DAW) needs to be run as an administrator (or with administrator privileges). Please look for question "Q15" (full title: "Q15. After installing any of the SuperWave commercial plugins, I can’t hear any sound. Is there a problem with my VST Host when running SuperWave plugins?", currently a third level heading) for more information about the issue from the Support section of SuperWave (https://www.superwavesynths.com/support).\
"""
accessibility_description = """\
The plugin parameters can be edited with the Automation Window of the digital audio workstation (tested on REAPER 6.73 with OSARA and Psycle Modular Music Creation Studio version 1.12.0 by using its native "Parameter List" function, found under the Plugin Window (Shift+Enter) and its "View" menu). (Note: on OSARA, please press P to access the Parameter Window of a track where Equinoxe VST instrument is used in order to access the parameters of Equinoxe). The Sequencer On/Of switch and the MIDI Learn function are not accessible for a screen reader user and require sighted assistance to be executed. For example, a work-around on using the sequencer button is to make two presets (for an instance, with the REAPER or Psycle program) and to have the sighted person press the Sequencer On /Off switch and make presets so that the sequencer is turned on (preset name example: "equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_on") and where it is turned off (preset name example: "equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_off"). Then, a blind person can independently load the .fxp filesusing the load function of the VST host or digital audio workstation (DAW) (such as the "Preset menu" or "+" button in REAPER's FX Window) to load the preset to the track where Equinoxe is located in. Because of these facts stated above, the accessibility ratio (a rough estimate of the accessibility of the plugin) is about 55-65 percent. 

It is worth mentioning that a blind user should ask a registry file (with the .reg extension) to be provided by the developer via an email. The .reg file allows a blind user to register the products (including Equinoxe) independently because the registry information (i.e. license key and user ID) are stored on that file. To execute it, please press the Enter key few times. First, the Windows system should ask you if you wanted the registry changes included in the file to be stored on the registry (please answer "Yes" on this question). Finally, the Windows system should announce that the registration was successfully made so please quit the dialog with the press of the "OK" button.\

Fusion-IR is a unique modulated convolution-based capture and reproduction technology developed specifically around the needs of M7. It redefines the rules of acoustic and workflow possibilities for convolution based reverberation processors.

Nothing comes closer to M7 hardware than Seventh Heaven Professional.

Now used around the world, from the smallest mountain-top backpack studios to the biggest post production facilities in London and Los Angeles, Seventh Heaven Professional is the definitive way to experience the power and beauty of M7 reverbs natively within your DAW in up to Atmos 7.1.6.

The M7 excels in presenting the world’s most realistic simulation of rooms, spaces and plates in the most flattering of lights.
From tight, realistic interiors, chambers and studios to lush outdoor expanses, cathedrals and halls, the M7 can do it all.
Seventh Heaven Professional includes every single preset available in the Bricasti M7.
This includes all v1 and v2 firmware revision presets, including the special nonlinear reverbs and even additional interiors presets not available in hardware.
It took many months of fully automated capture to produce the thousands of Fusion-IRs needed for Seventh Heaven Professional. Only then could the true finesse of the modulated hardware be achieved via convolution. The early reflections, low frequency reverb, and late reverb were captured individually for the ultimate in control and acoustic realism.

The Sound And Flexibility of Algorithmic Reverbs

Treat Seventh Heaven Professional like any algorithmic reverb and forget what you’ve heard about the lifeless sound of convolution. It doesn’t apply here.
In a sampled reverb it is typically impossible to sculpt a space as required, and as is expected from users of hardware and software algorithmic reverbs. Even simple, critical tasks such as balancing the early and late reverb are impossible jobs with most convolution reverbs. Not to mention, usually any modulation is completely lost and the captures lose the organic life of the hardware.
Not so in Seventh Heaven Professional. It has the flexibility of algorithmic reverbs allowing you to perfect the acoustics of a space just as can be done on an M7 and retains the organic, lively vibe thought to be impossible to capture.
You can even use the stereo captures in surround workflows. LiquidSonics’ advanced impulse response decorrelation technology ensures excellent fold-down compatibility and the convenience of up to 7.1.6 workflows in your DAW.
Vast Editing Potential

The Ultimate Reverb Tails

The M7’s lush, rich decays are the star of the show. The original v1 decays are the most realistic ever heard, and the v2 exhibit stunning modulation qualities.
Every preset’s decay can be set across the M7’s full decay time range (from 200 milliseconds right up to 30 seconds).

Delays With Added Tempo Synchronisation

The M7’s pre-delay and multi-voice delay can be modified as freely as within the hardware itself.
Seventh Heaven Professional takes a further step by providing the ability to sync pre-delay and delay to DAW tempo.

Reflection Pattern Selection

Each and every modulated early reflection pattern has been captured and can be freely swapped at will. Any space can be absolutely transformed, an unprecedented feat for a sampled reverb.
Advanced Equalisation

Precise Roll-off Filtering

The M7’s unique roll-off curves are perfectly designed for its reverberation and reflections. Each curve (different for v1/v2 decay and early reflections) was studied and reproduced in every available position. This provides an extremely accurate reproduction of this critical component in the acoustic chain.

5-band Post-EQ

The M7’s early and late reverb filters have been augmented with a full 5-band parametric equaliser in Seventh Heaven Professional.

Frequency Dependent Reverb Decay Times

Seventh Heaven Professional also includes the ability to apply post-process low and high frequency decay time modification to the reverb.

Ducking

Ducking is a very powerful tool that helps you improve clarity of a reverb by tucking the wet away until a musical phrase has ended, the reverb simply floods in to fill the space rather than competing with the instrument itself.\

The unmistakable plate reverb sound – warm, rich and spacious – is now at your fingertips.

Inspired by the original EMT 140 plate reverb, we captured the gorgeous sound and vibe of this studio classic and turned it into a fun and musically inspiring plug-in. And we couldn’t resist pushing the limits of reality, so we added a couple of fun twists that let you take Little Plate to spaces the original hardware only dreamed of.

Simple Control, Infinite Possibilities

Once we recreated the iconic 140 sound, we couldn’t resist going even further.
While the original reverb could only muster a modest five seconds of reverberation time, we pushed that number higher. A lot higher. With Decay Time set to infinity, Little Plate’s reverb tails never fade away. Check out these audio clips of presets that demonstrate this:

Keep your reverb and your mixes clean with the built-in Low Cut filter.

Sometimes the low frequency build-up in reverbs can get a little out of control. Use the Low Cut control to tame those boomy bass frequencies.

Flip the Mod switch to introduce slight modulation into the reverb tail.

These subtle and chaotic variations can result in a thicker and smoother sound, especially at long decay times on pitched instruments like keys, guitar, and voice.

Heavy Vibes

At Soundtoys, we’ve got a reputation for obsessing over legendary hardware. But when we decided to build our first reverb plug-in, we went farther than ever before. We collected five EMT 140s from around the country and gathered them in our lab.
We tuned them up. We teched them out. We went to the chiropractor (that’s one and a half tons of plate reverb). Then we took our time listening and testing, zeroing in on a sound that we think captures the classic EMT 140 vibe. Warm, rich, spacious and slightly dark, Little Plate packs the essence of plate reverb into one little plug-in that won’t break your back.

A Little Plate History

The EMT 140 uses a magnetic transducer to vibrate a massive sheet of metal, sending the result back to the engineer via a pickup that captures the resulting reverberation.
The EMT 140 was introduced in 1957 and was capable of dense and smooth reverberation unlike anything the world had heard. While it doesn’t exactly sound like a real room, it has a beauty of its own, which is why plate reverb is still such a sought-after sound even many decades later. 140s are getting hard to find though, and replacement parts even harder. Not to mention their sheer size and weight keep them out of reach of the average studio.\
