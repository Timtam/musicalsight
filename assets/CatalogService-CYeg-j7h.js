Everything was lovingly recorded & processed at a famous hi-tech British Studio through one of the greatest custom NEVE desks in existence. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe wanted to create a hyper-realistic virtual instrument that pays an homage to its counter-part in reality – the incredibly versatile and studio defacto, Yamaha C7. The piano is best described as incredibly versatile and fantastic for pop, rock, classical, fusion and all in-between. The sustain samples were carefully crafted at both pedal up and pedal down positions. We also have bonus sampled staccato and staccatissimo notes (w/round robin each), so you have the correct attack for faster runs. In addition, the library gives you full control over the dynamic response as well as mechanics and tone, so you can dial in the perfect sound & dynamic match for your workflow – all simply done with a click of the mouse. We also included full control over resonance, room tone and signal chain noise, non-tonal key control, unique release triggers for hammer action, string damping, and release triggers for our room and ambient microphones.

You can easily balance each articulation and assign each style its own dedicated Key-switch or Midi CC. Whether you are building a template and need to separate the long and short articulations; building performance-based patches out of the dozens of playing styles; or creating a custom set of patches needed for your specific arrangement, Adagio gives you the power to shape this iconic sound to your workflow.\\r\\n\\r\\nSay goodbye to Multis. With the update to Adagio, you will find various remastered layered Legato articulations made from 11 independent styles of lyrical Legato.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Legatos have been completely reworked and redesigned to make expressive string writing completely effortless. The new legatos now adapt to the way you play, a softer velocity will trigger a more passionate set of Legato transitions, whereas playing more intensely triggers Legatos with a stronger transition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Adagio series was recorded in a beautiful church environment and contains three main groups of master violinists: Full Ensemble Violins (11 Players), Small Ensemble or Chamber Violins (3 Players) and a Solo Virtuoso Violinist (1 Player). Each section was sampled to capture the raw emotions and true expression within each string ensemble. Every articulation has been extensively sampled, including a total of 11 individual legato techniques, each with up to three times round robin, and a wealth of dynamic short notes including multiple styles of Spiccato. Each articulation is sampled with movement and character; the natural expression in each sample makes for a truly authentic playing experience that will be instantly noticeable in your next production."},"aura-guitars":{"vendor":"8dio","name":"Aura Guitars","categories":["vsti.guitar"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt","5"]],"url":"https://8dio.com/products/aura-guitars-for-kontakt-vst-au-aax","size":8330,"demo":"https://soundcloud.com/8dawn/8dio-aura-guitars-the-nexus-by","price":238,"description":"8Dio Aura Guitars is the ultimate collection of deep-sampled motion picture guitars.  Aura Guitars contains 12 different guitars, including Martin, 12 String, Dobro, Mandolin, Ukulele, 8 String Schecter, Silent Guitar, Stratocaster, Telecaster, Les Paul and assortment of Bass Guitars. It contains both multi-sampled single notes and multi-sampled chords. All the chords were sampled in perfect fifth, so you can essentially generate any chord and rhythm you want. All 12 guitars were sampled symmetrically – meaning that you can freely blend anything you want and it will work together. So you literally have billions of patch combinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAura Guitars contains 3 modules, so you can freely mix and blend up to three different guitars together. The collection spans over 9GB of content (lossless compressed from 17GB) and several thousand auras. Aura Guitars also contains an advanced grid-sequencer, which allows you to completely create your own signature rhythms by using velocity, pan, pitch and on/off functions for each step in the Aura. All the guitars were also multi-sampled, so when you play chords you can freely mix between muted/non-tonal strums and glide into rich, open chords by using the modwheel. In addition we also multi-sampled the single notes, so you can create more realistic sounding guitar rhythms.\\r\\n\\r\\nAura Guitars is designed for instant gratification. It is insanely easy to use and get inspired – and it also allows you to go incredibly deep and even into the realm of chaos. We created chaos features both both patches, grid-sequencing and FX.

They will vary the phrase beginnings, and perhaps start some quietly, some with an FP, some with a stutter, and so we have included five options for this, to ensure that your compositions sound evolving, musical, and extremely convincing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe width of the stereo mic perspective can be changed by dragging the bottom pair of microphones in the interface, and dynamics can be brought up and down by either the mod wheel or expression Midi CC - depending on whether you have MOD or EXP selected in the bottom right hand corner of the instrument GUI, and the shorts' dynamics are controlled by velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour True-sampled Legato Styles\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a while tackling how to approach allowing the user to play both slow more drawn out passages, and then also being able to create realistic renditions of more virtuosic, fast passages, and eventually came up with a very intricate technique which allows both.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sampled these intervals completely differently, and set it up so you can switch between these depending on whether you are playing fast or not. So for the faster legato, you can switch to \\"fast\\" with the legato keyswitching, and play intervals up to and including a minor third in your scales and runs, maintaining a very realistic sound. The sound of the note transitions on a violin when playing fast is completely different from the sound when playing slower, and both are captured and skilfully programmed into this instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypes of Legato\\r\\n\\r\\n* Slurred Legato - switching note with the finger only, without changing bow direction... the smoothest legato sound.\\r\\n* Bowed Legato - changing the bow at the note change. A more noticeable interval. (slurred and bowed legato are both essential in obtaining a realistic and well phrased performance)\\r\\n* Portamento Legato - a subtle slide between notes.\\r\\n* Fast Legato - Specially sampled intervals which allow you to play fast runs/scales with intervals up to a minor third between each note - something seriously lacking and rarely possible with most sample libraries.\\r\\n\\r\\nARTICULATION LIST\\r\\n\\r\\n* Normal Sustain\\r\\n* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)\\r\\n* Crescendo\\r\\n* FP (loud then suddenly quiet with a crescendo back up)\\r\\n* Marcato (A more accented pronounced attack and note)\\r\\n* Harmonics\\r\\n* Tremolo\\r\\n* Trill Semitonevirtuosicviolinmanual\\r\\n* Trill Tone\\r\\n* Eight sets/combinations of grace note shorts\\r\\n* Octave up shorts\\r\\n* Pizzicato\\r\\n* Spiccato\\r\\n* Staccato on-string (detached playing without lifting the bow)\\r\\n* Major chords\\r\\n* Minor chords\\r\\n"},"octohorn":{"vendor":"auddict","name":"Octohorn","url":"https://www.auddict.com/octohorn","categories":["vsti.brass"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt","4"]],"price":60,"demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2lXGlGrMwo","size":7000,"description":"We are proud to present Octohorn, the first release from our brass series, with an eight-player French Horn ensemble, boasting no less then seven mic positions, with the aims of giving you absolute and ultimate control over your soundscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis instrument was created with the intentions of producing something in a completely new league of sonic sculpt-ability, able to sit in a track with the depth and spread of a real ensemble recording. We have achieved this through multiple new and innovative features, including the seven mic positions, carefully set to cover the whole soundscape, recorded chords and octaves to minimize \\"sample layering\\" in tracks, which kills the depth of a track, and much more...\\r\\n\\r\\nMix between the perspectives; Decca tree sides and mid, flanks, room, woodwind spots (see more about this below!), close ribbons and close LDCs, with the flexibility aimed at replicating a real scoring session. Now you have control over the different mic and perspective levels in the session, enabling you to morph your own sound in your scores, as if you were at the studio with the console at your fingertips.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might have noticed that one of the perspectives included is \\"woodwind spots\\". While this is not a woodwind library, the mics that spot the woodwinds were set up and included in the recording. The reason for this, is that a lot of the brass sound bleeds heavily into the woodwind mics in scoring sessions, adding to the perceived depth of the sound, so whilst pushing to achieve the most versatile, we felt that this absolutely had to be included.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree True-sampled Legato Styles\\r\\n\\r\\nThe instrument comes with three true legato modes - a normal slurred legato, a sample octave legato, and a fast legato, for faster passages,which will allow you to play virtuoso runs and scale passages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason we included octave sustains and legato, is because when you play octaves by layering the same instrument twice, what you are hearing is no longer a real octave passage, but two sets of the exact same horns, in the exact same position, layered on top of one another. When an ensemble plays real octave, every note has it's own sonic space and position in hall, and therefore in the perceived depth/stereo field, and you lose this by layering samples. For this reason, we recorded octave sustains and legato specially for a completely true and real sound. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot only did we just record the octaves, we recorded major and minor chords in various positions, as well as open fifths (combined gives you the ability to also create MAJ7, min7 and other chords... again for the reason that each note has it's own little space in the sonic field, and it is this separation that is one of the major things we miss from a real recording, and a track with layer upon layer of samples. With this instrument, you can achieve that real spacious sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull list of articulations:\\r\\n\\r\\n* No Legato (allows polyphonic playing)\\r\\n* Legato - normal slurred legato (piano and forte dynamic layers crossfade-able)\\r\\n* Oct Legato - True octave legato\\r\\n* Fst Legato - Fast legato specially for fast playing\\r\\n* Stutter (a quick stuttered grace note before the main sustain)\\r\\n* Chords < - Crescendo major, minor and open 5th chords\\r\\n* Chords > - Diminuendo major, minor and open 5th chords\\r\\n* Staccato - Short notes, with up to 5RR per dynamic layer (three layers)\\r\\n"},"angel-strings-1":{"vendor":"auddict","name":"Angel Strings Vol. 1","url":"https://www.auddict.com/angelstrings","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SBcXNDK45U","price":220,"categories":["vsti.strings"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt","4"]],"size":60000,"description":"Music composition and production is constantly evolving, and the tools used to create music need to evolve along with this.

Gravitas morphs between an orchestral grand and a synthetic piano engineered by top sound designers, while Red Planet layers in electric guitar for out-of-this-world tones.\\r\\n\\r\\nLush, spacious, and rich in tone, Klavier is a versatile, top-quality hybrid and underscore piano instrument that is incredibly easy to use. At the core of Klavier, we have two instruments: The first, our Gravitas Piano, allows you to morph between a deeply sampled orchestral grand piano, and synthetic piano sound design created by some of the top trailer composers and sound designers out there. The second, our Red Planet Piano, allows you to morph between our deeply sampled orchestral grand and electric guitar sound design layers. With this wide range of sonic possibilities, Klavier serves as an incredibly useful instrument for a wide range of music.\\r\\n\\r\\nGravitas Piano (Piano meets Sound Design).\\r\\n\\r\\nAUDIO IMPERIA's “Klavier\\" is the first instrument in our new “Private Stock Instruments” series. Originally intended as a private sample library for a group of trailer composers, the two instruments in this series combine the very best of the worlds of raw/organic recordings and post-production/sound design. The goal throughout the whole project was to start with the user experience and the raw sound and to work our way backwards to a final product that is both versatile and instantly inspiring.\\r\\nThe Gravitas Piano was designed specifically for trailer music. A piano that can cut through in a big and epic mix, yet still retain a lot of warmth and depth. To achieve this, we used a set of six stereo microphones and then combined these with their corresponding sound-designed (“Synthetic”) counterparts in post production.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganic Piano: Yamaha Baby Grand Piano\\r\\n\\r\\n* 2x Brauner Phantom Classic Front End Audio Microphones (above the piano)\\r\\n* 2x DPA 4011A Cardioid Microphones (below the piano)\\r\\n* 2x Neumann KM184 Small-diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphones (above the keys, one on each side of the player)\\r\\n* 2x Neumann U87 Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphones (inside the lid)\\r\\n* 2x Coles 4038 Ribbon Microphones (inside the lid)\\r\\n* 2x Earthworks QTC40 Small-diaphragm Omnidirectional Condenser Microphones (room)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gravitas Piano comes with 35 “Synthetic” presets, made by some of the best producers in the trailer industry. These “Synthetic” presets can be accessed via the preset control on the “Synthetic” side of the piano. The “Organic” piano offers both Sustained and Staccato articulations. All of the “Synthetic” presets were made using the original samples from the “Organic” piano. No synthesizers or other instruments were used, just pure sound manipulation and sound design.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Attila Áts\\r\\n* Bryan Leach\\r\\n* Danny Cocke\\r\\n* Jeremiah Pena\\r\\n* Joshua Crispin aka Generdyn\\r\\n* Paul Ortiz aka Chimp Spanner\\r\\n\\r\\nRed Planet Piano (Piano meets Electric Guitar).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “Red Planet Piano” was heavily inspired by the movie adaptation of Andy Weir’s “The Martian”. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is absolutely amazing and inspired us to create an “outer space” version of the Klavier. \\r\\nThe Red Planet Piano shares the same organic sample pool used for the Gravitas Piano. But to get that particular “outer space” electric guitar sound, we created a number of complex guitar sounds. They are designed to match that lush and wide sound that you need to evoke that feeling of depth and space. This, combined with the organic piano, creates a truly unique sound.\\r\\nWe used a blend of the neck (humbucker) and the split-coil (single coil) position of the very limited Ibanez JPM90HAM. A perfect blend of the single coil twang and directness and the warmth and depth of the neck humbucker. The initial recordings were done direct and we then reamped the recordings through various amp and fx signal chains."},"legacy":{"vendor":"audio-imperia","name":"Legacy - Cinematic SFX Collection","url":"https://www.audioimperia.com/collections/all/products/legacy-cinematic-sfx-collection-for-kontakt-player","categories":["vsti.synthesizer"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt-player","6"]],"nks":true,"price":199,"size":4120,"demo":"https://soundcloud.com/audioimperia/sets/legacy","accessibility_description":"Audio Imperia products come with additional mic positions turned off by default, which need to be enabled with sighted help and cannot be turned on with NKS alone.","description":"Assimilating some of Audio Imperia’s most popular science-fiction and superhero sound effects products in one package, Legacy beams up sci-fi composition tools like Event Horizon, Dark Dimensions and Terraform with the superhero composer Scenes From The Multiverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy is a collection of the best of our first year products consolidated into one incredibly versatile sound design and sound effects product: Scenes from the Multiverse, Event Horizon, Dark Dimensions and Terraform.

If you want to change the order of the rhythms you can do that too, by dragging them around.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Legato turned on, new notes start sync-ed with previous held notes. This way it's possible to create convincing lines by changing notes according to the rhythms, as seen in the demos.\\r\\n\\r\\nPattern Strings has an Automatic Bow Direction feature. It plays downbow samples on downbeats and upbow samples on upbeats, which creates a natural ebb and flow between beats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tempo Sync switch allows you to set the sample playback to half speed or double speed.\\r\\nSome of the samples were recorded at 90bpm, and others at 80bpm. So, let's say you're working at 160bpm. This would mean that the 90bpm samples would be time stretched to twice their original speed! To make up for this, you could use the Tempo Sync option to set the speed to be half as fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the combinations of instruments have been rendered down, both single and with stereo doubling. This makes it possible to layer instruments together without so much memory and cpu.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Pattern Strings contains 8.32GB of samples, the interface was designed with a Dynamic Loading system so that it only loads what you need. In order to make it more efficient, combinations of instruments have been rendered together, saving on voice count and memory. This way if all instruments are enabled, it will use the same amount of memory and CPU as if only one instrument was enabled.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeef up the sound of an instrument by turning on Doubling. Stereo-doubled samples have been rendered down, so turning this on won't increase the number of voices or memory needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSay you're using Pattern Strings on a track, and you have a couple of different variations you want to use at different parts of the track. Rather than opening up multiple instances, you could save variations into Custom Keyswitches.\\r\\nJust click “Map”, then click on one of the colored keys at the very bottom of the keyboard, and Voilà, the current pattern can now be recalled by that key!\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerate a sequence of rhythms using the Random Button, and perhaps you will find something useful."},"sospiro-strings":{"vendor":"ben-osterhouse","name":"Sospiro Strings","categories":["vsti.strings"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt","5"]],"size":3190,"url":"https://www.lootaudio.com/category/kontakt-instruments/ben-osterhouse/sospiro-strings-ben-osterhouse-kontakt","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs-XkdmhK4A","price":47,"description":"Sospiro Strings is a Kontakt library for creating slow, emotive strings.

The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option. All of the swells were originally recorded at 110 BPM\\r\\n* The non-vibrato swells have a clear tone which especially brings attention to the change in tone as each instrument louder and softer.\\r\\nEach version, Vibrato and non-vibrato has a single velocity layer. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the Length in Beats slider, you can choose the appropriate length, and the corresponding swell will be chosen and time-stretched if needed.\\r\\nThe Length Multiplier is useful if you have a project with a fast bpm and you want it to sound slow, or vice versa.\\r\\nThe Smart Release feature makes it so that however far into the crescendo-ing part of the sample you have held the note, it will jump that far from the end of the swell. This means that the longer you hold a note, the longer its release will be.\\r\\nAll of the swells can be either vibrato or non-vibrato. The vibrato adds warmth and individuality to the sound, but may be a bit over dramatic in some cases. The non-vibrato has a lot of clarity, and especially brings attention to change in tone as each instrument gets louder and softer. The vibrato samples sound better or worse depending on how much they are being timed-stretched, which is why it is especially nice to have non-vibrato as an option.\\r\\nThe Sync feature is one of the most essential features: with Sync enabled, any notes you add or change in a chord will sync with the first note that was played.\\r\\nThere are 3 varieties of Sustains:\\r\\n\\r\\n* The cold sustains are played with a slow bow and no vibrato --a fragile sound at the edge of breaking.\\r\\n* The warm sustains are played over the fingerboard with a fast, freely changing bow and generous vibrato.\\r\\n* The full sustains are played closer to the bridge with a slow, heavy bow. Vibrato is used with discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an option to double the sound, which layers two instances together and pans them slightly apart. This sounds better if you are only using one instrument by itself and only playing a few notes at a time.

Dark Horizon is built from the same engine as ELYSION, creating an even darker sound palette with new presets, themes, and effects. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Extraordinary and Dark Bass Sound\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a focus on dark, dirty bass sounds, Dark Horizon pushes levels and tones not yet explored by the Elysion series. Space engineer Tobias Menguser sent wavs into the far reaches of the cosmos, beyond the known universe, where only the terrifying nightmares and figments of reality lurk. In those unknown places, the sounds were twisted and experimented upon, crafting a full sound palette of dark and low basses. They mutated into growling instruments, screaming oscillations, and ground-shaking subs.\\r\\nFor Modern Producers and Score Composers\\r\\nFor ambient, modern electronic, and experimental music, Dark Horizon can bring a new power into your work with its library of grinds and grooves. For scoring and blockbusters, these sounds make for perfect tension-building underscore.\\r\\nDark Horizon  - What´s Included?\\r\\nAs the deep underbelly of the Elysion series, Dark Horizon is a powerful Kontakt instrument that resynthesizes orchestral sounds and sound FX along with a great variety of rare analog synths and FX boxes. The resulting instruments are mind-crushing sounds, gut-wrenching themes, rhythmic arps, whirling pads, and a set of effects to push them even further beyond the imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Ambient - Resynthesized - Cinematic - Dark Horizon pushes sounds into unrecognizable extremes, utilizing analogue rack effects and the dark powers of eldritch gods. Use Dark Horizon as a scoring tool for any project that needs a dose of profound bass and gritty depth or use it as a really exceptional synth to create innovative melodies with outstanding sonic power.\\r\\n* Layered - Dirty - Powerful - With four layers of sounds and an onboard compressor, delay, and hall reverb, create unique and disturbing combinations for a truly original experience. Each layer is linked to an independent arpeggiator and two pan engines, allowing you to easily create complex, evolving pads.\\r\\n* Sampling Redefined - Bursting with Expression and Variety - We recorded, sampled and produced the sounds, treating them like acoustic instruments. This results in an unimaginable dynamic and unprecedented sound.

In this approach the recordings of a real vibrato play an important role, as they are always more inspiring and organic than adding an artificial vibrato.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticulations, Patches & True Legato\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional Cello was created from well over 100 articulations and their variants. By means of an elaborate and intelligent script, countless articulations are linked together in a meaningful way so that they follow the playing style of the user.\\r\\nThe library contains three master patches, including the \\"Emotional Cello\\", the \\"Sulponticello\\" and the \\"Harmonic Cello\\". These contain most of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. Three different transition types have been captured in several sessions and simulate, among other things, realistic changes in bowing direction or passionate portamento while playing. The user simply controls the velocity - the tempo of the tone transitions automatically adapts to your DAW!\\r\\nIn addition to the Master Patch, the Emotional Cello also contains an Individuals Patch which is a set of key switch patches with different articulations of the same category such as sustains, shorts, trills and more. The Specials Patch offers some unusual articulations and effects and the Stackable Patch contains the main articulations with standardized key switching to match the stackable patches of Emotional Violin & Emotional Viola.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelection of the included playing styles:\\r\\nSpiccimo & frog, Stacc, Fast Spiccato, Frog Madness, Pizzicato, Delicate, Delicate fast, Proud Vibrato\\r\\nHero Vibrato, Martele half NV 8RR, Martele half Vib 4RR, Pickup, Fortepiano, Vivid, Paganini Run, Moderate 2, Sustain Non Vib XFDe, Expressive XFDe, Pastorale, Pastorale slow, Tremolo, Trill HAT,\\r\\nTrill WT.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnament Key Switches\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ornament Key Switches are another great feature. Unlike the articulation key switches, these are temporary and allow variations of the already selected articulation. By pressing one of the Ornament Key Switches, the current playing style can be faded into another articulation or variations can be generated. Last but not least, the Ornament MKS offer typical effects like glissando, flageolet and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Effects\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to customize the sound of the Cello according to your wishes, you can use effects specially designed for the instrument.

This long anticipated and logical addition to the cello and violin, represents a very comprehensive virtual instrument that is easy to play, and of course offers numerous possibilities for individual customization.\\r\\nNot only does the Emotional Viola harmonize excellently with the cello and the violin, it is also highly valued as a solo instrument with its direct and unadulterated sound, its variety of essential to extraordinary articulations as well as true legato and rebowing.\\r\\nEmotional Viola is the first choice if you are looking for the perfect instrument for film scoring, pop music, songwriting, classical or modern, avant-garde viola compositions!\\r\\n\\r\\nContextual Sampling\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the other instruments from the Emotional series, the Munich-based developers decided to stay true to their concept of contextual sampling in which all samples are always recorded in a musical context to capture the natural bowing and expressiveness of real instrumentalists. In this approach, the recordings of a real vibrato play an important role, as they are always more inspiring and organic than adding an artificial vibrato.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticulations, Patches & True Legato\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional Viola was created from well over 50 articulations and their variants. By means of an elaborate and intelligent script, countless articulations are wisely linked together, so that they follow the user’s style of playing.\\r\\nThe Emotional Viola Master Patch contains most of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. Three different transition types have been captured in several sessions and simulate, among other things, realistic changes in bowing direction or passionate portamento while playing. The user simply controls the velocity - the tempo of the tone transitions automatically adapts to your DAW!\\r\\nIn addition to the Master Patch, the Emotional Viola also contains an Individuals Patch which is a set of key switch patches with different articulations of the same category such as sustains, shorts, trills and more. The Specials Patch offers some unusual articulations and effects and the Stackable Patch contains the main articulations with standardized key switching to match the stackable patches of Emotional Cello & Emotional Viola.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelection of the included playing styles:\\r\\nSpiccato, Rota Spicc, Pizzicato, Fliegender Aufstrich, Delicate Phrased, Delicate Sustain, Touch Sense Espressive, Espressivo Long, Progressive Vibrato Phrased, Progressive Vibrato Long, Expressive Brahms, Brahms Long, Arpeggio Shorts RR, Rota Vivid, Czardas Sfz, Sustain Vib XFDe, Sustain Non Vib XFDe, Kernig NV Shorts, Nordic Long, Nordic Variety, Fast Lines Late Vib, Fast Lines Swelling Vib, Tremolo XFDe, Trill HT, Trill WT, Flautando, Nordic, Morbid, Harmonics, Sulponticello XFDE, Sul C, Undulation Wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnament Key Switches\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ornament Key Switches are another great feature. Unlike the articulation key switches, these are temporary and allow variations of the already selected articulation. By pressing one of the Ornament Key Switches, the current playing style can be faded into another articulation or variations can be generated. Last but not least, the Ornament MKS offer typical effects like glissando, flageolet and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Effects\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to customize the sound of the viola according to your wishes, you can use effects specially designed for the instrument. These include a 3-band EQ, a switchable sordino and a timbre function. The latter contains 15 convolution-based presets from renowned and experienced sound engineers for easy and characteristic modulation of the basic sound.\\r\\nFor the use of the Viola as 1st chair viola in an orchestral environment, there are also timbre EQs which place the viola in its correct position in the orchestra room.

A unique, virtual instrument that convinces through its variety of articulations, its direct and unadulterated sound and functions like True Legato and Rebowing. With its impressive and at the same time emotional sound, it enables expressions that have never been achieved before.\\r\\n\\r\\nContextual Sampling\\r\\n\\r\\nOur philosophy during the recordings is called \\"Contextual Sampling\\". In order to find the perfect sound, several string instruments were sampled in various ways over a period of four years. We came to the conclusion that no technique comes even close to the actual and natural vibrato of a trained musician. The samples of true legato were always much more inspiring and had a more organic feel than added artificial legato. So our goal was to perfectly capture these musical aspects and combine them into a great sounding and easy to play instrument.\\r\\nEmotional Violin consists of more than 100 articulations and their variations. Through elaborate, intelligent scripting countless articulations were usefully linked, so that they follow the user’s style of playing. This is the secret of Emotional Violin that makes for its exceedingly realistic and authentic sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaster Patches & True Legato\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional Violin contains three Master Patches, including „Emotional Violin“ and „Intimate Violin“. These contain a multitude of the recorded articulations, which logically interlock and provide an elegantly aligned sound, thanks to „True Legato“. In total, 3 different transition types were captured in countless sessions, which perfectly simulate bow changes or passionate portamento, easily controlled via velocity. The speed of the transitions automatically matches your DAW’s tempo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrnament Keyswitches\\r\\n\\r\\nA special highlight are the Ornament Keyswitches. Unlike the articulation keyswitches, these are designed for the moment, to bring variations into chosen articulations. This way you can blend from a current playing style to another one (e.g. trills and tremolos) or you can generate variations (e.g. bow changes, to smoothly end a note), just by pushing an Ornament Keyswitch (e.g. trills and tremolos). Last but not least the Ornament MKS offer typical violin-effects like glissando (up and down), flageolett and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective sound shaping\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional Violin offers a small but mighty collection of sound shaping possibilities, specifically tailored to the instrument. Aside from a typical 3-band EQ and a connectable sordino you will find timbre functions.\\r\\n4 famous and experienced sound engineers created these convolution based presets (so called\\r\\nTimbre Impulses) that allow for an easy and characterful modulation of the violin sound. To use the violin as 1st Chair Violin in an orchestral arrangement, we added a timbre EQ that places the violin in the correct orchestral seating. The icing on the cake are modules „Room“ and „Reverb“, which provide the sound of actual rooms, thanks to professionally recorded convolution presets - plus they can be tweaked separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are the artist!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo meet the requirements of your playing, Emotional Violin offers additional features. At „Poly Legato“, for example, it automatically recognises whether a bound melody line or an chord is played and via „Legato Trimming“ you can manually set the speed of legato and portamento transitions. A speciality represents the attack feature, which enables the user to add a start sample independent of the selected articulation - for instance to add short or harsh starting notes during legato. The correct tuning is also provided: via the „Micro Tuning Option“ you can apply established tunings to the violin (e.g. pythagorean, Werkmeister III, and many more) or create entirely new ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is a library with unsurpassed authenticity\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional Violin offers a multitude of articulations - also unusual ones - you won’t find in any other library. Aside from the 3 big Master Patches, you will find more than 70 articulations structured in categories and available as Multi-Keyswitch-Patches - from expressive sustains, to pinpoint shorts with up 9 Round Robins, to trills and exotic effects, to dynamic crossfades within four layers. You can deactivate unused playing styles / keyswitches at any time via the „Purge“ feature, freeing up working storage for other instruments. So if you prefer to not work exclusively with keyswitches, this method perfectly suits you.\\r\\nSimply select from one of the following\\r\\nNormal Sustains with and without Vibrato, Multiple Progressive Vibratos, Multiple Espressivo, Flautando, Sul Ponticello, Morbid Sustains, Harmonics, Multiple Spiccatos, Staccato, Marcato, Tremolo, Tremolo Sul Ponticello, Multiple Trills, Pizzicato, Pizzicato Snap, Paganini Pizzicato, Scratches, Piazolla FX, Diverse Violin Effekte, Violin Percussions\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Recording\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emotional Violin was recorded at the Mastermix Studio near Munich in a wood-panelled room with a large ceiling height and at the greatest possible distance to the wall. For maximum flexibility, two Neumann KM184 and U87 microphones were used very closely. Therefore the room amount is quite subtle, so you can use your own effects for further processing. However, you can also use the integrated Convolution Reverb.\\r\\nKontakt Player 5.7.3 or higher required.\\r\\nEmotional Violin is the second virtual instrument in this series, produced by Harmonic Subtones, the makers of Emotional Cello."},"ethno-world-6-instruments":{"vendor":"best-service","name":"Ethno World 6 - Instruments","categories":["vsti.ethnic"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt-player","5"]],"size":15330,"url":"https://www.bestservice.com/en/ethno_world_6_instruments.html","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SzDQAxT_BU","price":259,"nks":true,"description":"The ultimate Sample-library for Ethnic Instruments from all over the World\\r\\n\\r\\nETHNO WORLD 6 Instruments is the summit of a library that has continuously been growing and improving for over 16 years.

You have the option to change each of these sequences separately, which gives you the ability to make more intricate compositions.\\r\\n* Pure Performance Legato - We are pleased to present a powerful legato engine that has undergone a complete redesign. Because the engine can differentiate between the two articulations without the use of keyswitches, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any hassles.\\r\\n* Main Page: Voicing Selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or choose from over 90 pre-arranged Voicings. The Ensemble Engine is just like having a real-life orchestrator working for you.\\r\\n* Additional presets and multi-instruments - Discover how the Voicings (208 presets), Rhythms (239 presets), and Animated Orchestra settings (223 presets) work with the 5-part arranging engine by exploring the presets to get the most out of \\"The Orchestra Complete 3\\". Updated Voicings that use and bring together the expanded libraries in innovative and expressive ways are also included in \\"The Orchestra Complete 3\\".\\r\\n* MIDI Export - \\"The Orchestra Complete 3\\" comes with MIDI-Export. Patterns and arrangements generated by the engine can be exported onto separate MIDI Tracks, opening endless possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Core – The Ensemble Engine\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ensemble Engine works through a number of independent arpeggiators and velocity envelopes, heavily inspired by the Sonuscore Origins-Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate Complex Arrangements With Simple Chords\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate pulsating rhythms and inspiring full arrangements with simple chords and without the use of any pre-recorded phrases. At the heart of \\"The Orchestra Complete 3\\" is the Ensemble Engine, which allows this inspiring dance of instruments and rhythms to unfold before your very eyes with only the press of a chord.\\r\\n\\r\\n* 3 independent arpeggiators and 2 velocity envelopes can be assigned to create vivid and powerful orchestral voicings\\r\\n* Create and customize your own patterns through the sequencer designer.\\r\\n* Load up to 5 different instruments in independent slots and play them together.\\r\\n* Every slot can be assigned to one of five different modules.\\r\\n* Assign percussion to the arpeggiator to create pulsating rhythms.\\r\\n* Voicings selection - Assign which instrument plays which note of the chord to allow for more realistic ensemble sounds. Or you can choose from our 90+ pre-arranged Voicings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompose Faster with Full Instrumental Groups\\r\\n\\r\\nChoose from nearly 700 Presets in Three Categories.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Orchestral Voicings - Orchestral Voicings include various playable arrangements of instruments that create the fullest and richest orchestral sound.\\r\\n* Orchestral Rhythms - Orchestral Rhythms presets bring you cinematic and expressive rhythms that take full advantage of the Ensemble Engine.\\r\\n* Animated Orchestra - Making full use of all the possibilities of the Ensemble Engine, the Animated Orchestra presets are for the most complex and magical musical ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nExport Your Custom Performance\\r\\n\\r\\nDrag and drop MIDI to your DAW. Once you have been inspired by a preset or have created your own complex arrangement, drag and drop your passage right from the Kontakt orchestra nki to your DAW. Unleash the power of the Customizer Engine onto your personal template, change notes, combine different patterns, and make them your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake Full Control Over The Ensemble\\r\\n\\r\\nWork quickly and intuitively with our straightforward user interface.\\r\\nOn the Engine page you can access all individual controls for each of the five instrument modules. Short notes can be arranged with the arpeggiators, while sustained notes can be shaped with the velocity envelope. Create the orchestral colors as you need them and let the magic happen.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Arpeggiator - The arpeggiator creates fascinating melodic patterns to give your project a rich and lively orchestral feeling. Change the pattern of the arpeggiator with the rhythm stepper. If needed, you can modify almost every parameter to stay in full control of your orchestral voicing.\\r\\n* Sequence Designer - The Sequence Designer is included in the arpeggiator. This allows you to create in detail your own musical passages. Instead of following the specific styles of preset arpeggios, create your own and make it as complex as you’d like.\\r\\n* Velocity Envelope - Shape your sustain sounds with the Velocity Envelope, adding to your sound a recurring dynamic movement from a sustained note. The centerpiece is the envelope shape, which can be drawn freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlay Over 280 Instruments / Articulations Freely\\r\\n\\r\\nCreate full and detailed orchestrations from scratch. Play your ideas and your melodies freely with countless single instruments. Included are all standard sections and articulations from a symphonic orchestra, including percussion as well as tonal percussion (Marimbaphone, Vibraphone, Xylophone and Glockenspiel) and as a bonus: choir, piano, cembalo, celesta and a massive church organ.\\r\\n\\r\\nPure Performance Legato\\r\\n\\r\\nWith our Pure Performance Legato technology, you can play both fast true legato and staccato runs without any problems, as the engine can distinguish between both articulations without the need for keyswitches. Special attention was paid to the integration of the true legato transitions, fitting each of the more than 400 transitions per instrument independently into the intervals in a way that allows for a very smooth and playable legato.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnsemble-Multi Patches: Unleash The Full Orchestral Power\\r\\n\\r\\nMultis take the Ensemble Engine even further toward instant playability and epic sound as they load and layer multiple instances of \\"The Orchestra\\". The easiest way to create complex orchestral arrangements.\\r\\nThere are full playable orchestral multis for single articulations that work perfectly for quick sketching and layering. Orchestral Rhythm and Animated Orchestra Multis combine multiple instances of the Ensemble Engine to create even more complex patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Samples: Rough, Unpolished And Human\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Orchestra\\" was recorded and processed with the intention to sound a bit rougher and more “honest” than the common Hollywood-sounding orchestra vst. It offers an alternative and promises straight and powerful sounds, punch and a vivid musical experience.\\r\\nThe instruments for \\"The Orchestra\\" were recorded in Budapest at the renowned Studio 22 in their traditional seating position and mixed and edited with great attention to detail. This way the different sections blend together perfectly in the same room. All essential articulations are available, including playable true legato samples and multiple round robins for short articulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreset Browser\\r\\n\\r\\nThe updated preset browser is available for \\"The Orchestra Complete 3\\", \\"Strings Of Winter\\", \\"Horns Of Hell\\" and \\"Woods of the Wild\\".

With a steadily increasing number of contracts and growing customer base it has since become a leader in soundtrack composition and sound design on the European computer game market. In 2005 Dynamedion produced highly successful, first benchmark live orchestra recordings for a German game soundtrack, setting the standard for large-scale projects in the industry. With numerous further orchestral productions for the video game industry, Dynamedion has earned itself a reputation for unsurpassed quality and integrity in this area.\\r\\nMinimum required free Kontakt Player or full Kontakt version 6.7"},"big-fish-audio-and-funk-soul-productions-ambient-black":{"vendor":"big-fish-audio","name":"Ambient Black","categories":["vsti.ambient"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt-player","5"]],"size":3430,"url":"https://www.bigfishaudio.com/Ambient-Black","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCSv8x0rWjM","price":199.95,"description":"Ambient Black is the second of a linked pair of sound design-based virtual instruments designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original instruments and textures suitable for all sorts of ambient music.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs its name implies, Ambient Black covers the darker end of the ambient spectrum, focusing on harsh, aggressive, atonal, mysterious, and industrial sounds. Ambient White, the first VI in this series, covers the opposite end of the ambient spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of sounds used in the creation of Ambient Black were derived from organic sources: found sounds and audio recordings subjected to extreme sound design techniques, prepared and heavily processed musical instruments, and sounds recorded in natural environments. The synth sounds were also processed with sound design techniques, and combined with various organic sounds and instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end result is a product that combines acoustic, human, industrial, and electronic elements to produce an organic-sounding virtual instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE INSTRUMENT PATCHES\\r\\n\\r\\nAmbient Black features over 280 different instrument patches and combinations (over 6.5 GB of uncompressed WAV data), divided into seven categories:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Effects & Textures\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most complex instrument patches in Ambient Black are the Multi-Layered Instruments, created using combinations of patches from the other six categories. These patches are organized by their basic type, using the following prefixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n* ATMOS: Layered Atmospheres and Pads\\r\\n* BASS: Layered Bass Instruments\\r\\n* FX: Layered Effects & Textures\\r\\n* LOOP: Layered Looped Phrases\\r\\n* MELO: Layered Melodic Instruments\\r\\n* PERC: Layered Percussive Instruments\\r\\n\\r\\nMULTI-LAYERED INSTRUMENT PATCHES\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the Multi-Layered Instrument patches consist of multiple evolving atmospheres, effects, textures, and looped phrases. For the best results, try playing these patches with one finger, or in octaves. This suggestion doesn't apply to Layered PERC patches, which in general don't have any pronounced melodic or harmonic content; playing multiple notes at a time with these layered patches can produce some interesting polyrhythmic patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nEFFECTS & TEXTURES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Effects & Textures category includes a number of strange and aggressive sounds that were primarily designed to be used as cinematic sound design elements. Most don't have an identifiable pitch or key-center, and can be used as drones.\\r\\n\\r\\nPERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Percussive Instruments include several different acoustic, industrial, and electronic drum kits. There's also a selection of cinematic hits, glitches, industrial sounds, and other unusual percussive sounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nDRONES & ATMOSPHERES\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the Drones & Atmospheres are long and evolve over time. Try holding a key for 10, 20, or even 30 seconds, and listen to how each of these sounds develop. Because most of these sounds are huge and dense, try playing just single notes or octaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMELODIC AND BASS INSTRUMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Melodic and Bass Instruments are mainly single-note patches. However, a few of these patches also have some underlying harmonic content, and can be used as pads.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOOPED INSTRUMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Looped Instruments include simple repeating patterns and some complex patterns created by mixing multiple loops together. Some loops do not lock to tempo intentionally in order to add an element of randomness and unpredictability to some of the patches. Looped Instruments should be played like the Drones & Atmospheres, using solo notes or octaves for less-complex patterns and different intervals for more experimental and harmonically-dense effects."},"big-fish-audio-and-funk-soul-productions-ambient-white":{"vendor":"big-fish-audio","name":"Ambient White","categories":["vsti.ambient"],"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt-player","5"]],"size":3950,"url":"https://www.bigfishaudio.com/Ambient-White","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1nyhjS2s8A","price":199.95,"description":"Ambient White is the first of a linked pair of sound design-based virtual instruments designed to provide composers and producers with a collection of original instruments and textures suitable for all sorts of ambient music.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs its name implies, Ambient White covers the lighter end of the ambient spectrum, focusing on beautiful, peaceful, melodic, harmonious, and natural sounds.

There's also a selection of tuned hand drums, cymbals and gongs, and other percussive sounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nPADS & ATMOSPHERES\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the Pads & Atmospheres also include chordal components.

If you're producing retro or indie-style music on a budget, or if you're a TV or film composer working on a tight deadline, VRS can be used to create live-sounding drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, and percussion tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPTURING THAT VINTAGE RHYTHM SECTION SOUND\\r\\n\\r\\nLike its sister-products, Vintage Horns and Vintage Strings, Vintage Rhythm Section was not designed to be a shiny, perfect-sounding virtual instrument.

Some of this old gear was pretty funky-sounding, which probably would have disqualified it from being used on most other types of sample libraries. But for VRS, it was just what we were looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\nVRS features two easy-to-use GUIs:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) A 12-channel mixer for drums\\r\\n2) The main GUI, which is used for all of the keyboards, basses, and guitars.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DRUM MIXER\\r\\n\\r\\n- Reverb Select: This is a drop-down menu that allows you to select various types of convolution IRs.\\r\\n- Channel Strips: Each offers controls for Treble, Bass, Reverb Amount, Pan, and Solo/Mute. Note that not all kits have the same number of toms and cymbals. Instead, each kit was custom-built to fit the musical genre and era it came from.\\r\\n- Master Channel: Allows you to add tape saturation (SAT) and/or compression (COMP) to the entire kit.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAIN GUI\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom top to bottom and left to right, this GUI has the following controls:\\r\\n\\r\\n- TAPE SAT adds tape-style saturation/compression\\r\\n- TREBLE adds or cuts high end\\r\\n- BASS adds or cuts low end\\r\\n- DISTORTION SWITCH - use this to turn the effect on or off\\r\\n- DISTORTION adds amp-style distortion\\r\\n- DELAY controls the amount of tape-style delay\\r\\n- DELAY SELECT allows you to choose from several types of delay\\r\\n- ROTATOR SWITCH turs Leslie-style effect on or off\\r\\n- ROTATOR allows you to select the speed of the Leslie-effect\\r\\n- REVERB controls the amount of reverb added\\r\\n- REVERB SELECT allows you to choose from a selection of high-quality Convolution Reverbs designed to replicate a number of vintage amp-reverbs and recording spaces\\r\\n- MOD-WAH SWITCH turns on your controller's Mod Wheel as a wah-wah pedal\\r\\n\\r\\nKey-Switches\\r\\n\\r\\nKey-switching is a function that allows the user to quickly change from one articulation to another.

Whether you're an experienced arranger or casual producer, Vintage Strings was designed to make it quick and easy for you to create great sounding string tracks for your productions. Like its sister product, Vintage Horns, Vintage Strings was not designed to be a shiny, perfect sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way string sections sounded back in the '60s and '70s; including the decidedly not classical playing style and minor imperfections that added character to those sections and made them sound so good.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Vintage Strings we recorded a 6 piece violin section using vintage Neuman U-87 mics and Royer ribbon mics run through a great sounding SSL board. To capture a true vintage string sound, we used close mics, room mics, and string section positioning based on actual session notes from old Motown and Philly Soul recording sessions. Rather than record the violins in a magnificent concert hall or some other large and resonant recording space, we recorded our players in a funky old studio with a smaller, less-reverberant room that had characteristics similar to the rooms used to record classic Soul and R&B records. Using the tracks we recorded in this space, we then created three types of sections:\\r\\n\\r\\n2 VIOLINS:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2VLN patches are very useful for creating the sound of smaller string sections. Even if played in 3-part harmony, these patches sound like a 6 piece section, rather than a full orchestral string section. The 2VLN patches take up a lot less sonic space in the mix, and also have the advantage of sounding like the smaller types of string sections used on a lot of old Soul and R&B records, which didn't have the time or budget to record a larger section.\\r\\n\\r\\n6 VIOLINS:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 6VLN patches are great for recording unison (1 part) lines that emulate the sound of a true 6 violin section, which was very commonly used in many old Soul recordings. When used for 2-part harmonies or octaves these patches can be used to replicate the sound of an overdubbed 6 violin section (i.e., a faux 12 violin section), which was a very common recording technique used on many Motown recording sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\n12 VIOLINS:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 12VLN patches are very useful for creating unison (1 part) string lines that sound like an overdubbed 6 violin section. If you want to get a bigger sound with the size of a larger orchestral string section, without the color and character present in a large recroding hall or symphonic space, use the patches for string parts in 2 or 3 part harmonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is a virtual instrument that has a sound and character that is distinctly different from orchestral based sampled string libraries. The sound of Vintage Strings is intentionally not big, rich, and glossy. It's a smaller, more intimate, and more \\"human\\" sound, which more accurately emulates the string sound on those classic old records.\\r\\n\\r\\nFAST AND EASY STRING SECTION PARTS USING PRE-SET PATCHES\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don't have a lot experience writing for strings, or even if you're an experienced string-arranger on a tight deadline, Vintage Strings also offers a number of pre-programmed instrument patches that can help you quickly create great sounding string parts. These include the Tonal Harmonization Patches, which contain 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part patches for 2, 6, and 12 violins. Playing with just one finger on your keyboard you can easily write string lines in 2 parts (intervals), 3 parts (triads), or 4 parts (seventh chords). Secondly, the Tonal Harmonization patches include Fixed Chord & Interval Patches containing 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part Chord Patches, for 2, 6, and 12 violins. These patches are programmed to play a specific interval or chord according to the type of patch in 12 different keys.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VINTAGE STRINGS GUI\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vintage Strings graphical user interface (GUI) is very simple and easy to use. The main page of the interface includes control over tape saturation, high EQ, and reverb with 15 custom selected convolution reverbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HARMONIZE PAGE\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Harmonize page you can choose the key and scale of the interval or chord-based preset patches, or create custom interval and chord-based patches of your own.\\r\\n\\r\\nFEATURES:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 3 group sizes: 2, 6, and 12 players\\r\\n* Recorded with the highest quality vintage outboard gear\\r\\n* 11 articulations\\r\\n* Auto harmonization feature for impressively quick arranging\\r\\n* Hand selected IR options available for the convolution reverb\\r\\n* 5.1GB (uncompressed)\\r\\n* Kontakt Player 5 included\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPLETE PATCH LIST:\\r\\n\\r\\n2-Violin Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n2VLN CHR = long articulations as the default, with key-switches for staccato, swells,\\r\\nmajor & minor runs up and down, fall-offs, tremolo, harmonics, and pizzicato.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle Articulation Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 2VLN CHR Sustain + Staccato\\r\\n* 2VLN CHR Swells\\r\\n* 2VLN CHR Fall-Offs\\r\\n* 2VLN CHR Tremolo\\r\\n* 2VLN CHR Harmonics\\r\\n* 2VLN CHR Pizzicato\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed Harmonized Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 2-Part Major 3rds\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 2-Part Octaves\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 2-Part Minor 3rds\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 3-Part Major Triad\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 3-Part Minor Triad\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 3-Part Diminished Triad\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 3-Part Sus 4 Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 4-Part Major 7th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 4-Part Minor 7th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 4-Part Dominant 7th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 5-Part Major 9th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 5-Part Minor 9th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 5-Part Dominant 9th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN FXD 5-Part Dominant 7th #9 Chord\\r\\n\\r\\nTonal Harmonized Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 2VLN TNL 2-Part 3rds\\r\\n* 2VLN TNL 3-Part Triad\\r\\n* 2VLN TNL 4-Part 7th Chord\\r\\n* 2VLN TNL 5-Part 9th Chord\\r\\n\\r\\n6-Violin Patches\\r\\n\\r\\n6VLN CHR = long articulations as the default, with key-switch layers for staccato, swells,\\r\\nmajor & minor runs up and down, fall-offs, tremolo, harmonics, and pizzicato.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle Articulation Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Sustain + Staccato\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Swells\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Major Runs Up\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Major Runs Down\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Minor Runs Up\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Minor Runs Down\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Fall-Offs\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Tremolo\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Harmonics\\r\\n* 6VLN CHR Pizzicato\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed Harmonized Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 2-Part Major 3rds\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 2-Part Minor 3rds\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 2-Part Octaves\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 3-Part Major Triad\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 3-Part Minor Triad\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 3-Part Diminished Triad\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 3-Part Sus 4 Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 4-Part Major 7th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 4-Part Minor 7th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 4-Part Dominant 7th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 5-Part Major 9th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 5-Part Minor 9th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 5-Part Dominant 9th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN FXD 5-Part Dominant 7th #9 Chord\\r\\n\\r\\nTonal Harmonized Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 6VLN TNL 2-Part 3rds\\r\\n* 6VLN TNL 3-Part Triad\\r\\n* 6VLN TNL 4-Part 7th Chord\\r\\n* 6VLN TNL 5-Part 9th Chord\\r\\n\\r\\n12-Violin Patches\\r\\n\\r\\n12VLN CHR = long articulations as the default, with key-switch layers for staccato, swells,\\r\\nmajor & minor runs up and down, fall-offs, tremolo, harmonics, and pizzicato.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle Articulation Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Sustain + Staccato\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Swells\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Major Runs Up\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Major Runs Down\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Minor Runs Up\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Minor Runs Down\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Fall-Offs\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Tremolo\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Harmonics\\r\\n* 12VLN CHR Pizzicato\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed Harmonized Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 2-Part Major 3rds\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 2-Part Minor 3rds\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 2-Part Octaves\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 3-Part Major Triad\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 3-Part Minor Triad\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 3-Part Diminished Triad\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 3-Part Sus 4 Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 4-Part Major 7th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 4-Part Minor 7th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 4-Part Dominant 7th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 5-Part Major 9th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 5-Part Minor 9th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 5-Part Dominant 9th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN FXD 5-Part Dominant 7th #9 Chord\\r\\n\\r\\nTonal Harmonized Patches:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 12VLN TNL 2-Part 3rds\\r\\n* 12VLN TNL 3-Part Triad\\r\\n* 12VLN TNL 4-Part 7th Chord\\r\\n* 12VLN TNL 5-Part 9th Chord\\r\\n\\r\\nMinimum System Requirements\\r\\n\\r\\nMac: Intel Core Duo, 2GB of RAM, and OS 10.7.x or later.

Play an instrument one way and it has a percussive quality; play it another, and the notes expand into a pad or atmosphere. Play a patch in one octave and it sounds dreamy and surreal; play it in another octave and it behaves and sounds quite differently.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what soft synths, sound modules, or VIs you already own, Zodiac will expand the palette of sounds in your sonic tool box and add a unique character to your music.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zodiac GUI\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its somewhat enigmatic appearance, Zodiac's Graphic User Interface (GUI) is quite simple to use.

CINEMATIC STUDIO WOODWINDS\\r\\n\\r\\nCinematic Studio Woodwinds is the latest addition to the Cinematic Studio Series collection. Whether you want to blow the roof off with the bright penetrating sound of the piccolo, express emotion with the beautiful lyrical oboe, or vibrate the floor with the deep and powerful bass clarinet, these superb instruments bring warmth and vitality to your orchestral template. They perfectly complement the rest of the series: the Strings, Solo Strings, Brass and Piano.\\r\\n\\r\\nINTUITIVE, EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the heart of Cinematic Studio Woodwinds is its intuitive and efficient GUI. This means one patch per instrument, easily assignable keyswitches and MIDI CCs, and a full mixer with output routing options plus reverb. To save memory, articulations can be loaded in or out of RAM with a couple of clicks. As the layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings and Brass, these features and many others are all accessible via the main GUI page.\\r\\n\\r\\nBROAD PALETTE — SOLOISTS AND SECTIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nTo record Cinematic Studio Woodwinds we used a marvellous selection of top-tier players to capture the full range and character of each of nine solo instruments and four sections. Whether you want the fine detail of a soloist, or the warm collaborative synergy of our two-player sections, we recorded the full dynamic range to harness both nuance and power. Every instrument was treated equally, including the piccolo, cor anglais, alto flute, bass clarinet and contrabassoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nVERSATILITY AND REALISM\\r\\n\\r\\nCSW features a range of articulations including playful short notes, expansive textures with flutter-tongue and trills, and a stunningly realistic legato engine. We spent countless hours recording true long-form legato transitions for each note, resulting in unparalleled realism. Because we’ve kept an authentic, human element in the sound you’ll feel like you’re in the room with the players.

We recorded the full dynamic range across every instrument, so when you play hard, you’ll hear hard – thanks to our talented players giving their all in every session. There’s nothing like hearing a brass ensemble really bring a room to life, and that’s exactly the sensation we’ve captured here.\\r\\n\\r\\nUNRIVALED REALISM AND CONSISTENCY\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ve broken new ground here with our smooth and powerful legato and marcato articulations. Long-form legato was captured across the entire dynamic range – the result of countless hours of recordings and retakes. You’ll be swept away by the level of realism we’ve achieved. In addition the legato scripting has been upgraded with further under-the-hood functionality, so sculpting new melodic phrases is easier than ever.

CSSS brings you solo violins 1 and 2, viola and cello to add a tantalising new dimension to your musical creations. We spent more than 120 hours recording Australia’s finest string players in a world-class scoring stage, using a unique combination of microphones to capture the individual character and charm of each instrument. The result is a stunning package of playable, realistic solo strings that stands out from the crowd either on their own, as an exquisite quartet, or as first chair for the full-section strings.\\r\\n\\r\\nINTUITIVE, EASY TO USE GUI\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GUI is streamlined and efficient, with a minimal number of patches making it quick and easy to learn. The layout is functionally the same as for Cinematic Studio Strings, so you can double the solo instrument patches with their section counterparts (eg Solo Violin I with 1st Violins), and play them at the same time on one MIDI channel. This first-chair functionality serves to reinforce the sound of each section, with the lush sound of the section bolstered by a 1st-chair solo patch. This blending together of the two libraries creates an even smoother, richer sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIRTUOSO SOLO, QUARTET OR FIRST CHAIR\\r\\n\\r\\nCinematic Studio Solo Strings brings all the emotional depth and virtuosity of an outstanding quartet to your fingertips, making it the perfect compositional tool for exposed lyrical solo or quartet passages. And because we maintained positional accuracy and recorded the same diverse range of articulations, CSSS provides a vibrant first-chair accompaniment to our full section library Cinematic Studio Strings. This allows you to seamlessly transition between writing for solo strings and full sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nUNPARALLELED REALISM\\r\\n\\r\\nCinematic Studio Solo Strings are expressive, emotive and powerful, with a smooth realistic sound that gives any melody that elusive human touch. Every sample was tuned by ear, and carefully edited and programmed to ensure that delicate balance between consistency, playability and realism. All of the dynamics have been preserved in their natural state, and as with CSS, no EQ or reverb was applied to the demos, so what you hear is the pure, out-of-the-box sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ARTICULATIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nCinematic Studio Solo Strings features a comprehensive list of playing articulations and styles, including true long-form legato for enhanced realism, portamentos and marcato.

It has two oscillators, an arpeggiator, effects (delay, limiter with drive, phaser, chorus tone control and reverb) and an envelope generator with DADSR (decay-attack-decay-sustain-release). Its first oscillator can also function as the Ultimate Oscillator which has a total of 16 fully programmable oscillators which can be stereo spread, detuned and synced separately. Oscillator 1 waveforms include Ultimate Osc, Tri Sync Osc, Noise, Triangle, Sf2 Exp and Saw. Oscillator 2 waveforms are Saw, Square, Noise, Perc and Triangle. The arpeggiator of Equinoxe handles both classic and phrase arpeggiation with modes such as Down/Back, Up/Forward, Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 (note: Alt meaning 'alternative'). The sequencer of Equinoxe is a 4 X 32 step sequencer (meaning that it has got 4 32-step sequencers). In each sequence, parameters such as position and modulation parameters can be edited. The sequencer supports the playing modes Forward and Reverse. The synthesizer also has two low frequency oscillators (LFOs). Equinoxe has two filters: a state-variable filter of -12 dB/-24 dB and a Moog filter (for the creation warm, vintage sounds). The Equinoxe comes bundled with Cubase projects and MIDI files to demonstrate the features of it. The songs \\"Magnetic Fields 2\\" and \\"Equinoxe 4\\" are supplied with the demo version and 12 additional tracks are supplied with the plugin when it is purchased from the author. Additionally, the SuperWave Drums Bundle, containing the SuperWave drum modules D-808, D-909 and Tiny Pops, is also provided free of charge. The plugin comes with 192 presets including basses, leads, strings, pads and sound effects. The presets of Equinoxe include \\"Oxygene 4 Lead 1\\", \\"Oxygene 4 Lead 2\\", \\"MFields 2 Lead 1\\", \\"FX Bird Tweets\\" and \\"FX Wind Fade 4\\". A feature worth mentioning is that Equinoxe also comes with an initialize bank, containing preset probrams (both fxb and fxp formats) for all the waveforms, including the Ultimate Oscillator waveforms such as Ramp and Soft Ramp. This way, it is easier (also for a blind user) to change the waveform of Equinoxe from one to another. After registering the plugin, it might happen that it won't play when trying to play with the synthesizer. This occurs due to the safety features introducet with Windows. To fix this problem, the digital audio workstation (DAW) needs to be run as an administrator (or with administrator privileges). Please look for question \\"Q15\\" (full title: \\"Q15. After installing any of the SuperWave commercial plugins, I can’t hear any sound. Is there a problem with my VST Host when running SuperWave plugins?\\", currently a third level heading) for more information about the issue from the Support section of SuperWave (https://www.superwavesynths.com/support).","accessibility_description":"The plugin parameters can be edited with the Automation Window of the digital audio workstation (tested on REAPER 6.73 with OSARA and Psycle Modular Music Creation Studio version 1.12.0 by using its native \\"Parameter List\\" function, found under the Plugin Window (Shift+Enter) and its \\"View\\" menu). (Note: on OSARA, please press P to access the Parameter Window of a track where Equinoxe VST instrument is used in order to access the parameters of Equinoxe). The Sequencer On/Of switch and the MIDI Learn function are not accessible for a screen reader user and require sighted assistance to be executed. For example, a work-around on using the sequencer button is to make two presets (for an instance, with the REAPER or Psycle program) and to have the sighted person press the Sequencer On /Off switch and make presets so that the sequencer is turned on (preset name example: \\"equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_on\\") and where it is turned off (preset name example: \\"equinoxe_wobbles_3_sequencer_turned_off\\"). Then, a blind person can independently load the .fxp filesusing the load function of the VST host or digital audio workstation (DAW) (such as the \\"Preset menu\\" or \\"+\\" button in REAPER's FX Window) to load the preset to the track where Equinoxe is located in. Because of these facts stated above, the accessibility ratio (a rough estimate of the accessibility of the plugin) is about 55-65 percent. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worth mentioning that a blind user should ask a registry file (with the .reg extension) to be provided by the developer via an email. The .reg file allows a blind user to register the products (including Equinoxe) independently because the registry information (i.e. license key and user ID) are stored on that file. To execute it, please press the Enter key few times. First, the Windows system should ask you if you wanted the registry changes included in the file to be stored on the registry (please answer \\"Yes\\" on this question). Finally, the Windows system should announce that the registration was successfully made so please quit the dialog with the press of the \\"OK\\" button.","os":["windows"]},"seventh-heaven-professional":{"vendor":"liquidsonics","name":"Seventh Heaven Professional","categories":["fx.reverb"],"size":3072,"url":"https://www.liquidsonics.com/software/seventh-heaven-professional/","demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI35bhu5fjo","price":299,"description":"The Best M7 Simulation Ever\\r\\nMade Possible With Fusion-IR\\r\\n\\r\\nFor years the Bricasti M7 eluded all attempts to capture and reproduce the subtle beauty of this legendary hardware. Many in the industry considered it impossible.\\r\\nFusion-IR is a unique modulated convolution-based capture and reproduction technology developed specifically around the needs of M7. It redefines the rules of acoustic and workflow possibilities for convolution based reverberation processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing comes closer to M7 hardware than Seventh Heaven Professional.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow used around the world, from the smallest mountain-top backpack studios to the biggest post production facilities in London and Los Angeles, Seventh Heaven Professional is the definitive way to experience the power and beauty of M7 reverbs natively within your DAW in up to Atmos 7.1.6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M7 excels in presenting the world’s most realistic simulation of rooms, spaces and plates in the most flattering of lights.\\r\\nFrom tight, realistic interiors, chambers and studios to lush outdoor expanses, cathedrals and halls, the M7 can do it all.\\r\\nSeventh Heaven Professional includes every single preset available in the Bricasti M7.\\r\\nThis includes all v1 and v2 firmware revision presets, including the special nonlinear reverbs and even additional interiors presets not available in hardware.\\r\\nIt took many months of fully automated capture to produce the thousands of Fusion-IRs needed for Seventh Heaven Professional. Only then could the true finesse of the modulated hardware be achieved via convolution. The early reflections, low frequency reverb, and late reverb were captured individually for the ultimate in control and acoustic realism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sound And Flexibility of Algorithmic Reverbs\\r\\n\\r\\nTreat Seventh Heaven Professional like any algorithmic reverb and forget what you’ve heard about the lifeless sound of convolution. It doesn’t apply here.\\r\\nIn a sampled reverb it is typically impossible to sculpt a space as required, and as is expected from users of hardware and software algorithmic reverbs. Even simple, critical tasks such as balancing the early and late reverb are impossible jobs with most convolution reverbs. Not to mention, usually any modulation is completely lost and the captures lose the organic life of the hardware.\\r\\nNot so in Seventh Heaven Professional. It has the flexibility of algorithmic reverbs allowing you to perfect the acoustics of a space just as can be done on an M7 and retains the organic, lively vibe thought to be impossible to capture.\\r\\nYou can even use the stereo captures in surround workflows. LiquidSonics’ advanced impulse response decorrelation technology ensures excellent fold-down compatibility and the convenience of up to 7.1.6 workflows in your DAW.\\r\\nVast Editing Potential\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ultimate Reverb Tails\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M7’s lush, rich decays are the star of the show. The original v1 decays are the most realistic ever heard, and the v2 exhibit stunning modulation qualities.\\r\\nEvery preset’s decay can be set across the M7’s full decay time range (from 200 milliseconds right up to 30 seconds).\\r\\n\\r\\nDelays With Added Tempo Synchronisation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M7’s pre-delay and multi-voice delay can be modified as freely as within the hardware itself.\\r\\nSeventh Heaven Professional takes a further step by providing the ability to sync pre-delay and delay to DAW tempo.\\r\\n\\r\\nReflection Pattern Selection\\r\\n\\r\\nEach and every modulated early reflection pattern has been captured and can be freely swapped at will. Any space can be absolutely transformed, an unprecedented feat for a sampled reverb.\\r\\nAdvanced Equalisation\\r\\n\\r\\nPrecise Roll-off Filtering\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M7’s unique roll-off curves are perfectly designed for its reverberation and reflections. Each curve (different for v1/v2 decay and early reflections) was studied and reproduced in every available position. This provides an extremely accurate reproduction of this critical component in the acoustic chain.\\r\\n\\r\\n5-band Post-EQ\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M7’s early and late reverb filters have been augmented with a full 5-band parametric equaliser in Seventh Heaven Professional.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequency Dependent Reverb Decay Times\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventh Heaven Professional also includes the ability to apply post-process low and high frequency decay time modification to the reverb.\\r\\n\\r\\nDucking\\r\\n\\r\\nDucking is a very powerful tool that helps you improve clarity of a reverb by tucking the wet away until a musical phrase has ended, the reverb simply floods in to fill the space rather than competing with the instrument itself.","accessibility_description":"All the parameters are accessible via the plug-in parameters.

And we couldn’t resist pushing the limits of reality, so we added a couple of fun twists that let you take Little Plate to spaces the original hardware only dreamed of.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimple Control, Infinite Possibilities\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce we recreated the iconic 140 sound, we couldn’t resist going even further.\\r\\nWhile the original reverb could only muster a modest five seconds of reverberation time, we pushed that number higher. A lot higher. With Decay Time set to infinity, Little Plate’s reverb tails never fade away. Check out these audio clips of presets that demonstrate this:\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep your reverb and your mixes clean with the built-in Low Cut filter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes the low frequency build-up in reverbs can get a little out of control. Use the Low Cut control to tame those boomy bass frequencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlip the Mod switch to introduce slight modulation into the reverb tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese subtle and chaotic variations can result in a thicker and smoother sound, especially at long decay times on pitched instruments like keys, guitar, and voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavy Vibes\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Soundtoys, we’ve got a reputation for obsessing over legendary hardware. But when we decided to build our first reverb plug-in, we went farther than ever before. We collected five EMT 140s from around the country and gathered them in our lab.\\r\\nWe tuned them up. We teched them out. We went to the chiropractor (that’s one and a half tons of plate reverb). Then we took our time listening and testing, zeroing in on a sound that we think captures the classic EMT 140 vibe. Warm, rich, spacious and slightly dark, Little Plate packs the essence of plate reverb into one little plug-in that won’t break your back.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Little Plate History\\r\\n\\r\\nThe EMT 140 uses a magnetic transducer to vibrate a massive sheet of metal, sending the result back to the engineer via a pickup that captures the resulting reverberation.\\r\\nThe EMT 140 was introduced in 1957 and was capable of dense and smooth reverberation unlike anything the world had heard. While it doesn’t exactly sound like a real room, it has a beauty of its own, which is why plate reverb is still such a sought-after sound even many decades later. 140s are getting hard to find though, and replacement parts even harder. Not to mention their sheer size and weight keep them out of reach of the average studio.","accessibility_description":"The plug-in parameters are accessible from within the DAW.

The most\\nimportant element they brought with them was their musical identity. East\\nIndian indentured laborers came mainly from the Hindu belt to cultivate the sugar\\nplantations, mainly in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname and Guyana.\\nThis sample library\\nincludes the two major musical subgenres that emerged in the history of West\\nIndian Creole musical innovations, both the result of the presence of East\\nIndian immigrants in the Caribbean.\\nChutney music evolved from\\nBhojpuri folk music. The main instruments used are the harmonium, the dhantal\\nand the dholak. This traditional Chutney is the original and organic form of\\nexpression of the Indian diaspora in the Caribbean. Chutney's melodies and\\nbeats have evolved over the years to accommodate changing technology and tastes\\nwhile evolving with advancements in the carnival industry, giving rise to the\\ncrossover genre of Chutney-Soca. However, Chutney still retains the frenetic\\nrhythms of the dholak, the melodic passages and soothing hums of the harmonium\\nas well as the traditional melodies and arrangements. At your fingertips is a\\nlibrary of authentic dholak, dhantal, and harmonium samples and loops. Vocal\\nsamples of ad-libs and popular expressions are also included to help you bring\\nthat instant cachet to your productions.\\nTassa drums evolved from\\nthe Plains of North and Central India. The main instruments used are the Dhol\\nor bass drum, the Caribbean equivalent of the nagara known as the kutter drum,\\nand the Jhanj cymbal. Tassa's infectious beat has become synonymous with\\npartying in the Twin Islands Republic. The thundering bass accompanied by the\\npiercing kutter awakens the body to put itself at its service. The Tassa is the\\nmainstay of all traditional Indian weddings and festivities. It now adapts\\nperfectly to any audio production.

This\\ninstrument contains 2 Go of samples of exceptional quality, coming from various\\nessential instruments constituting the Gamelan. Compatible with the free\\nKONTAKT PLAYER (and usable with KONTAKT as well), this instrument recreates the\\nrich, complex textures of Gamelan in its classic form, sampled with exquisite\\nrefinement; it also offers many features to modify and manipulate sounds in new\\ndirections. Created by acclaimed sound design studio Soniccouture, the sound of\\nthe BALINESE GAMELAN expansion seamlessly integrates with different musical\\ngenres and production styles - from TV and film production soundtracks to\\nelectronic music tracks, as well as to classical compositions for Gamelan.\\nA BRIEF PRESENTATION - THE\\nMUSIC OF THE GAMELAN The Gamelan (often translated as orchestra) is an\\nensemble of instruments originating from Indonesia, generally from Java or\\nBali. These ensembles can differ significantly, but are frequently composed of\\na combination of metallophones, xylophones, drums, and gongs, as well as bamboo\\nflutes, bowed or plucked strings, and even a vocalist. Each instrument was made\\nand tuned to play in that particular ensemble; tunings can therefore vary\\nconsiderably from one Gamelan to another. One of the most salient features of\\nBalinese Gamelan is that each instrument is paired, with each pair being\\nslightly out of tune. This creates a natural pulse between the different\\ninstruments - arguably the oldest chorus effect on the planet. Culturally,\\nBalinese Gamelan is strongly associated with religion; it is an integral part\\nof many Hindu ceremonies and is frequently performed during secular\\ncelebrations and festivals. Balinese Gamelan differs significantly from the\\nmore subdued, more \\"refined\\" style of its Javanese counterpart -\\nperhaps due to the different religious climates prevailing in these two\\nislands. Gamelan music is often characterized by its bright, metallic and\\npercussive sonorities, its distinctive and complex tuning, the rich layering of\\nits instruments and its cyclic form. The instruments themselves are often of\\nexceptional beauty; the Indonesian tradition considers that the Gamelan is a\\nsacred ensemble, each instrument of which is guided by the spirits.\\nBALINESE GAMELAN - THE\\nINSTRUMENT\\nThe instruments of this\\nextension have been sampled with incredible refinement, with the collaboration\\nof the Semara Dana Gamelan ensemble of the London Symphony Orchestra. This\\ntime-consuming process has preserved the organic, pulsating sound of the\\ninstruments perfectly, thanks to the incredibly meticulous recording of many\\nlayers of velocity - a phenomenal job done by Soniccouture. This instrument\\nincludes the three main elements of the large ensemble that makes up the\\nGamelan and focuses on compact versions of the tuned instruments, as well as\\nthe large gongs, paired metallophones and bronze drums. Instruments can be divided\\ninto the following categories:\\nThe Central Instruments:\\nResponsible for the main structure and melody, the central instruments include\\nthe Gongs, the Jegog, the Calung and the Penyacah. This instrument includes\\nboth the upper and lower groups of these detuned pairs; volume and pan\\npositioning can be easily controlled from the Kontakt interface.\\nThe Gangsa: The Gangsa is\\nmade up of paired metallophones, including Ugal, Pemadé and Kantilan. These are\\nenergetic and complex instruments, which adorn the main melody with\\nintertwining and rapid motifs. Again, KONTAKT's interface provides easy access\\nto volume and panning controls for these detuned pairs.\\nThe bronze drums: The\\nthird element of the BALINESE GAMELAN instrument is formed by the bronze drums,\\nwhich include the Trompong and the Reyong. These instruments have different\\nfunctions, depending on the type of Gamelan in which they are used. They are\\nsometimes used for melodic ornamentation or solo passages, and other times for\\nthe interpretation of very fast and complex passages, such as the Gangsa.\\nThe BALINESE GAMELAN\\ninstrument makes perfect use of the flexibility offered by the free KONTAKT\\nPLAYER and KONTAKT. Choose from the two different tones available - 'Full\\nVersion', for classic Balinese Gamelan tuning, and 'Concert', for a more\\n'Westernized' tuning, making it easy to layer Gamelan instruments with Western\\nsounds. A \\"Synth\\" version, available as an option, offers the\\npossibility of adjusting various parameters of the instruments, so as to manipulate\\nthem beyond their natural sound. The Jammer function acts as an arpeggiator,\\ncreating rhythmic arpeggios easily manipulated using the parameter controls;\\nanother function allows easy control of the volume and pan positioning of the\\ntwo detuned elements of the Gangsa or the central instruments.\\n Number of instruments:\\n12 instruments (NKI)"},"spotlight-collection-cuba":{"vendor":"native-instruments","name":"Spotlight Collection - Cuba","size":2740,"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt"]],"nks":true,"demo":"https://www.native-instruments.com/fileadmin/ni_media/producer/kontaktsoundpack/CUBA/audio/01_PK_Cuba_traditional_05_fast.mp3","description":"\\nA sound bank bringing\\ntogether the instruments and grooves of Cuban music.

Each run/arp has\\n2 round robins and can be run in every key and can sync to your host's tempo.\\nIn total, \\"Palette - Runs & Arps\\" includes more than 1600\\nperformances!\\nThe modern, easy-to-use\\ngraphical interface always displays the notation of the current performance or\\narp so you can see exactly what the orchestra is doing. For composers creating\\ndemos and intending to deliver finished scores to an orchestra, we've also\\nincluded the ability to drag and drop MIDI data for each performance onto your\\naudio software. You can also use it to easily layer performances with other\\nsamples. We've added several handy settings features like Downbeat Sync, which\\nensures that the final note of the performance always arrives at count 1 of the\\nnext bar. Tempo controls allow you to sync your host's tempo or adjust the BPM\\nmanually. The \\"In Quantize\\" button quantizes the beginning of the\\nperformance to the note value of your choice. There's also a powerful 8-slot FX\\nrack where you can choose from 19 high-quality FX.\\nAs with the entire Palette\\nrange, our players were recorded in a standard orchestral seated position with\\n3 microphone perspectives - near, decca tree and room. The room is spacious but\\nfairly dry, with just 1.2 seconds of tail, allowing easy mixing with other\\nlibraries using your favorite reverbs, so you're not limited to the sound of a\\nparticular room. As \\"Palette - Runs & Arps\\" was recorded by the\\nsame musicians and the production team with the same equipment and in the same\\nroom, it was designed to fit perfectly with all of Palette's other libraries."},"sounds-from-hell-ambience-and-underscore":{"vendor":"red-room-audio","name":"Sounds From Hell - Ambience and Underscore","size":15100,"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt","5.8.1"]],"nks":false,"demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHvMnsmIO_E","description":"\\nOver 16GB of textured\\nmelodic content, from 10 twisted creators, in 4 categories: Drones, Pads,\\nPulses and Soundscapes.

Henry Willis, considered the foremost organ builder of the\\nVictorian era, also built the organs for the Royal Albert Hall and St Paul's Cathedral.\\nThe Union Chapel organ remains essentially unchanged. The only significant\\nchanges were the replacement of the 4ft Gemshorn Choir with a 2ft Piccolo in\\n1909, the provision of an electric blower in the 1920s, and the installation of\\na balanced Swell pedal in the 1940s. As an important example from the work of\\nFather Willis, in 2012-2013, the organ was completely restored by organ\\nbuilders Harrison & Harrison based on historical principles. The original\\nhydraulic (water) blower motors have also been restored to working order by\\nJames Richardson-Jones and are retained as an alternative to electric blowing\\n(one of the very few left in the world!).\\nIt has three manuals,\\nSwell, Great Organ, Choir, and a full pedalboard.\\nPaul and his Spitfire\\ncolleagues waited a long time to select the organ they wanted to sample, and\\nthe timing was perfect with the restoration and collaboration with Union\\nChapel. They started the project in 2013 and many hours were spent during the\\nnight recording! This instrument has a lot of character and can go from\\nextraordinarily smooth and delicate to full of power without ever sounding\\nslightly synthetic or brittle like some of the newer instruments.\\nAs a bonus, Spitfire's\\nsound design team has created 10 eDNA presets using raw materials from the\\norgan, which recently featured in the Paul Feig reboot of Ghostbusters in 2016,\\nas well as a dev kit allowing the user to create their own unique synths. ,\\nBasses, Atmospheres and Pulsing Rhythm Patches ."},"afflatus-chapter-i-string":{"vendor":"strezov-sampling","name":"Afflatus Chapter I String","size":59400,"requires":[["native-instruments-kontakt","5.7.1"]],"nks":true,"demo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHyt8xMmGAE","description":"\\nStrezov Sampling has\\nopened the sale of the first sound bank of its new Afflatus series dedicated to\\nclassical and cinematic strings.\\nAfflatus Chapter I Strings\\nfor Kontakt, is not a simple bank of string samples but allows you to create\\nsets of various sizes and styles ranging from classical orchestral to modern\\ncinematic and more experimental things.\\nFor this, you benefit from\\nmore than 150 articulations captured with three microphone positions (close,\\ndecca and hall, two positions in the mixed sets), 25 true legato polyphonic bow\\nmovements, an automatic divisi function, random articulations or even a sound\\ndesign section in which you can mix different separate elements.
