Surge XT is a hybrid subtractive synthesizer which is

has two scenes which are a separate instances of the synthesizer
(except effects) that can be split or oalyered patches. Surge XT has
16 effect units (arranged in the following way: 4 inserts per scene, 4
master effects and 4 sends). The effects include filters, delay,
chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, frequency shifter, spring reverb,
rotary speaker, multi effects (such as Airwindows containing 56
effects, Mid-Side Tool and Conditioner) and Ensemble."""
accessibility_description = """This synthesizer is ground breaking in its level of accessibility. Very nearly every feature is available to the screen reader user via keyboard through the user interface. The parameter list is also an option but not necessary. The 2800 patches that come as standard can be both browsed and also searched for by name, category or author. 
This level of accessibility along with the rich feature set makes this synth a must try for any screen reader user 
There are plug-in and standalone versions for Windows and Mac but no accessible version for Linux. Installation is straightforward.
The UI is large and there is scope for improving ease of use to reduce the amount of key bashing and the graphical equaliser remains out of reach.
