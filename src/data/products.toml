has two scenes which are a separate instances of the synthesizer
(except effects) that can be split or oalyered patches. Surge XT has
16 effect units (arranged in the following way: 4 inserts per scene, 4
master effects and 4 sends). The effects include filters, delay,
chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, frequency shifter, spring reverb,
rotary speaker, multi effects (such as Airwindows containing 56
effects, Mid-Side Tool and Conditioner) and Ensemble."""
accessibility_description = """\
The synthesizer is almost entirely
accessible,, with very little accessibility issues on it. The user
interface can be efficiently navigated and controlled using keyboard
shortcuts on both the plugin and the standalone application, however,
this reuires putting certain settings to certain values using your
keyboard and screen reader. The Windows and Mac versions are currently
accessible, but the Linux version is not yet accessible. However, the
modulation section would still need a bit of accessibility
improvements. Currently, the 11-Band Graphic EQ (i.e. picture-based,
graphical equalizer) is not accessible for screen reader users."""
